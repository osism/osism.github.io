In blog posts with the tag [News](https://osism.github.io/blog/tags/news),
we will now write about news that are not directly related to a new
feature or one of our managed infrastrucutre environments.

Marc Sch√∂chlin, Site Reliability Engineer at the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community)
project, successfully completed the migration of [osism/testbed](https://github.com/osism/testbed)
from [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) to [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu)
yesterday. The migration went smoothly and basically only the Terraform binary
had to be replaced with the new OpenTofu binary.

More details in the SCS blog in the [Opensource - Testbed adopts OpenTofu](https://scs.community/2024/01/12/testbed-with-opentofu/)
article written by Marc.
