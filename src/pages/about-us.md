# About Us

OSISM GmbH is developing for more than 7 years a solution for the management of
sustainable and software-defined cloud infrastructures.

We enable fast, easy and consistent provisioning of compute, storage and network
resources to run cloud-native applications.

Our solution provides a solid and stable base for the deployment, operation and
lifecycle management of internal cloud infrastructures, for public cloud data
centres and, at the edge, for distributed systems. Our solution is also suitable
for building true supercomputers and HPC environments.
