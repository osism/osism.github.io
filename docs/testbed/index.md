# Testbed

With the OSISM Testbed, it is possible to run a full Sovereign Cloud Stack
deployment on an existing OpenStack environment such as Cleura or [REGIO.cloud](https://regio.digital).

OSISM is the reference implementation for the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) layer in the
[Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org) (SCS) project. The OSISM Testbed is therefore
used in the SCS project to test and work on the Infrastructure as a Service layer.

To get started with Testbed we first need to [prepare our environment](prerequisites.mdx).

:::info

The OSISM Testbed is intended as a playground. Further services and integration will
be added over time. An increasing number of best practices and experiences from the productive
deployments will be included here in the future. It will become more production-like
over time. However, at no point does it claim to represent a production setup exactly.
