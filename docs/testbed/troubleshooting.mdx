# Troubleshooting

## Ansible errors

Ansible errors that have something to do with undefined variables (e.g. `AnsibleUndefined`) are most likely due to cached facts that are no longer valid. The facts can be updated by running `osism apply facts`.

## Unsupported locale setting

```bash
$ make prepare
ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/check-local-versions.yml
ERROR: Ansible could not initialize the preferred locale: unsupported locale setting
make: *** [prepare] Error 1
```

To solve the problem you have to modify the `Makefile`. Change the 1st line as follows.

```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

To find out the locale used on the system `printenv` can be used.

```bash
$ printenv | grep -i lang|locale
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

## Static entries in `/etc/hosts`

If you are unable to access the following domains, you can customize your local `/etc/hosts`
with the following static entries. This may be necessary, for example, if you use Pi-hole and
all DNS entries from a public DNS with a non-public IP address are filtered.

```bash
