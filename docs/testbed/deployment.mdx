# Deployment

This section describes step by step how to deploy the OSISM Testbed.

## Initializing

1. Request access from the administrator of the respective cloud or get access to an OpenStack cloud.

2. Clone the [osism/testbed](https://github.com/osism/testbed) repository.

   The repository can also be cloned to any other location.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/osism
   git clone https://github.com/osism/testbed ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed
   cd ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed
   ```

3. Configure your cloud access profile

   The access data for the cloud provider used is stored in `terraform/clouds.yaml` and (optionally) in `terraform/secure.yaml` (same structure, if you want to store credentials in a separate place).

   In file [terraform/clouds.yaml.sample](https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/terraform/clouds.yaml.sample) you will find examples of typical setups. Settings that are identical for all users of a cloud can be defined centrally via the profiles of the file [terraform/clouds-public.yaml](https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/main/terraform/clouds-public.yaml). You can reference these settings by using the `profile` parameter in the cloud-specific definition in `terraform/clouds.yaml`.

   The user-specific settings of the `clouds.yaml` file are provided by the cloud provider. Please check the
   documentation of the cloud provider you are using or their support for details.

   [REGIO.cloud](https://regio.digital) is used as an example here. The cloud name in `clouds.yaml`
   and the environment name (value of `ENVIRONMENT`) are `regiocloud` in this case. It is important that
   the name of the cloud in `clouds.yaml` matches the name of the environment to be used. The names must
   be identical. It is currently not possible to name the cloud `regiocloud-123` in `clouds.yaml` if the
   environment is `regiocloud`.

   If another cloud is used, replace `regiocloud` with the respective profile name [from the table above](#cloud-access).

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="testbed-cloud-access-with-app-credentials" label="Application Credentials">
   The use of application credentials is preferred. This way it is not necessary to store
   details like username, project name or sensitive information like the password in the
   `clouds.yaml` file.

   The application credentials can be found in Horizon under **Identity**. Use `OSISM Testbed` as
   name and click `Create Application Credential`.

   ```yaml title="terraform/clouds.yaml"
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       profile: regiocloud
       auth:
         application_credential_id: ID
         application_credential_secret: SECRET
       auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
   ```

   If you want to make use of `terraform/secure.yaml` add your application credential secret there
   instead of `terraform/clouds.yaml`.

   ```yaml title="terraform/secure.yaml"
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       auth:
         application_credential_secret: SECRET
   ```


   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="testbed-cloud-access-with-username-password" label="Username/Password">
   ```yaml title="terraform/clouds.yaml"
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       profile: regiocloud
       auth:
         project_name: PROJECT
         username: USERNAME
         project_domain_name: DOMAIN
         user_domain_name: DOMAIN
   ```

   If you want to make use of `terraform/secure.yaml` add your password there instead of `terraform/clouds.yaml`.

   ```yaml title="terraform/secure.yaml"
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       auth:
         password: PASSWORD
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. Prepare for the deployment.

   The versions of Ansible and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) are managed
   automatically, and necessary dependencies are cloned.

   ```bash
   make prepare
   ```

   :::tip
   
   If any error occurs during preparation, and you want to run the preparation
   again, it is important to run `make wipe-local-install` first. Otherwise, the
   preparation will not be redone completely, and necessary parts will be missing
   later on.
   
   :::

## Start deployment 

1. Create the infrastructure with OpenTofu.

   ```bash
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud create
   ```

2. Deploy the OSISM manager and bootstrap all nodes.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="testbed-deploy-latest" label="Deploy latest manager version">
   ```bash
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud manager
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="testbed-deploy-stable" label="Deploy a stable manager version">
   ```bash
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud VERSION_MANAGER=8.0.1 manager
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   Replace the version with the version you prefer.
   Check the [OSISM release notes](https://osism.tech/docs/release-notes/)
   to find out what's available.

3. After the bootstrap, you can log in to the manager via SSH.

   ```bash
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login
   ```

   Yo can log in to the nodes of the cluster via the manager.

   ```bash
   osism console testbed-node-0
   ```

4. Deploy all services.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="testbed-deploy-multi-steps" label="Deployment in single steps">
   It is also possible to deploy the services step by step on the
   manager. To do this, first log in to the manager with `make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login`
   and then execute the deployment scripts one after the other. It is recommended to do this
   within a screen session.

   Deploying the services takes some time and depends on how much bandwidth is available,
   how the instances are equipped, etc. 90â€“120 minutes is not unusual when Ceph and OpenStack
   are fully deployed.

   To speed up the Ansible playbooks, [ARA](https://ara.recordsansible.org) can be disabled. This
   is done by executing `/opt/configuration/scripts/disable-ara.sh`. Run this script **before** the deployment scripts.
   Afterwards, no more logs are available in the ARA web
   interface. To re-enable ARA use `/opt/configuration/scripts/enable-ara.sh`.

   There is also the option of pre-population of images with `/opt/configuration/scripts/pull-images.sh`
   so that deployments do not have to be lengthy. Run this script **before** the deployment scripts.

   ```bash
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/001-helpers.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-ceph-with-ansible.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/200-infrastructure.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/300-openstack.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/500-kubernetes.sh
   ```

    Prepare OpenStack resources like public network, flavors and images by running
   `/opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap.sh`. Run this script **after** the deployment scripts.

   :::info

   If you only want to deploy the monitoring services with `/opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring.sh`,
   a few dependencies must be deployed first. You can then use the monitoring services without having to install a
   complete OpenStack & Ceph environment.

   ```bash
   osism apply common
   osism apply loadbalancer
   osism apply opensearch
   osism apply mariadb
   ```

   :::
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="testbed-deploy-single-step" label="Deployment of all services">
   In this single-step deployment, Ceph, OpenStack and all necessary
   infrastructure services (MariaDB, RabbitMQ, ...) are deployed.
   Depending on the cloud, the deployment will take some time. Up to two hours is not unusual. 

   ```bash
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud deploy
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Verify and adjust deployment

1. If you want to verify the deployment with [refstack](https://opendev.org/openinfra/refstack) run
   `/opt/configuration/scripts/check.sh`. This step will take some time and is optional.

2. The machine images required for the use of Kubernetes Cluster API and the amphora driver of OpenStack Octavia
    service are not provided by default to save resources on the OSISM Testbed and improve deployment time.
    These can be provisioned if required.

    ```bash
    /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap/301-openstack-octavia-amhpora-image.sh
    /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap/302-openstack-k8s-clusterapi-images.sh
    ```

3. If you want, you can create a test project with a test user after login. It also
    creates an instance with a volume attached to a network with a router. This step is optional.

    ```bash
    osism apply --environment openstack test
    ```

4. When the OSISM Testbed is no longer needed, it can be deleted.

    ```bash
    make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud clean
    ```
