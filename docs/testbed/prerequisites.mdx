# Prerequisites

## Cloud access

The usual prerequisite is to have an account on one of the supported OpenStack cloud providers.
As the OSISM Testbed also virtualizes systems itself, the OpenStack cluster should provide
the capabilities for nested virtualization.

It is not part of this guide to describe the registration with the individual cloud
providers. Please contact the respective cloud provider for this.

| Provider        | Product             | Profile name     | Note                               |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------|
| OSISM           | REGIO.cloud         | `regiocloud`     |                                    |
| OSISM           | REGIO.cloud         | `regio-fast`     |  boot from NVMe SSD backed volumes |
| Cleura          | Cleura              | `cleura`         |                                    |
| FUGA            | Fuga Cloud          | `fuga`           |                                    |
| HuaweiCloud     | HuaweiCloud         | `huaweicloud`    |                                    |
| OVH             | OVH                 | `ovh`            |                                    |
| T-Systems       | OpenTelekomCloud    | `otc`            |                                    |
| plusserver      | pluscloud open      | `pluscloudopen`  |                                    |
| plusserver      | pluscloud SCS Test  | `gx-scs`         |                                    |
| noris network   | Wavestack           | `wavestack`      |                                    |
| artcodix        | CNDS Cloud          | `artcodix`       |                                    |

For each cloud provider listed in the table, a predefined profile is available in the
`terraform/environments` directory. This profile contains the name of the public
network, which flavors to use, etc.

Here is an example from the profile for [REGIO.cloud](https://regio.digital).

```text
flavor_manager            = "SCS-4V-16-50"
flavor_node               = "SCS-8V-32-50"
volume_type               = "ssd"
image                     = "Ubuntu 24.04"
image_node                = "Ubuntu 24.04"
public                    = "public"
availability_zone         = "nova"
volume_availability_zone  = "nova"
network_availability_zone = "nova"
```

## Cloud resources

The OSISM Testbed requires at least the following project quota when using the default flavors:

| Resource              | Quantity  | Note                                          |

## Software

* `make` must be installed on the system
* [Wireguard](https://wireguard.com) or [`sshuttle`](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) must be installed on your system for VPN access
* Python must be installed, the Python version used must be at least 3.10, otherwise
  the current Ansible release cannot be used (more details in the
  [Ansible support matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix))
* `python3-venv` must be installed for managing Python dependencies like Ansible
