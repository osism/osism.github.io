# Contributor Guide

We welcome any issues, change requests or general feedback. Do not hestiate to [open an issue](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/new).

We use GitHub Issues to capture feature requests, feedback, bugs, etc. The tracker is available in the
[osism/issues](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues) repository. There are no specific requirements for the creation of an issue.
Error cases should be described in such a way that they are directly reproducible. The more outputs there are,
the better.

We use GitHub pull requests for contributions. The use of pull requets is documented in the
official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests).
The process in detail for the creation of a fork, branch etc. is also documented in the
official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).
It is recommended to use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com). Makes many steps easier.
