# Getting started

OSISM is a solution for the holistic management of sustainable, sovereign
software-defined cloud infrastructures. It provides a solid and stable base
for the deployment, operation and lifecycle management of on-premise cloud
infrastructures, for public cloud data centres and, at the edge,
for distributed systems. It is also suitable for building supercomputers and HPC
environments. OSISM enables fast, easy and consistent management and provisioning
of compute, storage and network resources to run cloud-native applications.

The documentation is organised into guides:

* The [Concept Guide](./guides/concept-guide/) explains which components and modules make up OSISM. It also
  explains the use cases.
* The [Deploy Guide](./guides/deploy-guide/) explains how the nodes of a cluster are created and bootstrapped.
  It also explains how the individual modules can be deployed.
* The [Upgrade Guide](./guides/upgrade-guide/) explains how the individual modules can be upgraded.
* The [Configuration Guide](./guides/configuration-guide/) explains how the individual modules can be
  configured.
* The [Operations Guide](./guides/operations-guide/) explains how individual tasks can be done in
  day-to-day business in a running cluster.
* The [Troubleshooting Guide](./guides/troubleshooting-guide/) explains how to resolve problems.
  It is an extension of the Operations Guide.
* The [User Guide](./guides/user-guide/) is intended for users of the individual components. It contains
  best practices, as well as other information.
