# Components

OSISM's software stack integrates a wide range of solutions, and adapts to your
environment, so you can build your infrastructure the way you need it.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**\
For IaaS OSISM uses [OpenStack](./openstack.md).

**Software Defined Storage (SDS)**\
To manage storage OSISM builds on [Ceph](./ceph.md).

**Bare Metal as a Service (BMaaS)**\
OSISM utilizes [Ironic](./ironic.md) for BMaaS.

**Software Defined Networking (SDN)**\
For SDN we build on [SONiC](https://sonicfoundation.dev/) & [OVN](https://www.ovn.org/).

**Kubernetes (K8s)**\
For our Kubernetes implementation OSISM counts on the lightweight [K3s](./k3s.md) Kubernetes distribution.

**Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS)**\
For easier deployment of Kubernetes clusters we use KaaS such as [Gardener](./gardener.md) and [Cluster API](./clusterapi.md).

**Access Management (IAM & PAM)**\
To manage access, OSISM builds on [Keycloak](./keycloak.md) for IAM, and [Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) for PAM.

**Logging, Monitoring and Telemetry**\
Logs are handled by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) & [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

**Realtime insights**\
OSISM builds on [Netdata](./netdata.md) for realtime insights.
