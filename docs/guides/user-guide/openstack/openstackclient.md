# Client

[OpenStackClient](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/) looks
for a `clouds.yaml` configuration file in the following locations:

- current directory
- `~/.config/openstack`
- `/etc/openstack`

With the OpenStack client you can specify the cloud profile specified in the `clouds.yaml`
configuration file  by providing the `--os-cloud <cloud identifier>` parameter.

```
openstack --os-cloud openstack network list
```

## Migration from openrc to clouds.yaml

If you have your `openrc` file  but you need this information in a `clouds.yaml` file,
this can easily be converted.

## With an editor

Example content of a `openrc` file downloaded from Horizon dashboard.

```sh title="PROJECT-openrc.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# To use an OpenStack cloud you need to authenticate against the Identity
# service named keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service Catalog**.
# The catalog contains the endpoints for all services the user/tenant has
# access to - such as Compute, Image Service, Identity, Object Storage, Block
# Storage, and Networking (code-named nova, glance, keystone, swift,
# cinder, and neutron).
#
# *NOTE*: Using the 3 *Identity API* does not necessarily mean any other
# OpenStack API is version 3. For example, your cloud provider may implement
# Image API v1.1, Block Storage API v2, and Compute API v2.0. OS_AUTH_URL is
# only for the Identity API served through keystone.
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://api.testbed.osism.xyz:5000/v3
# With the addition of Keystone we have standardized on the term **project**
# as the entity that owns the resources.
export OS_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID
export OS_PROJECT_NAME="PROJECT"
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="DOMAIN"
if [ -z "$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME" ]; then unset OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME; fi
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID="DOMAIN_ID"
if [ -z "$OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID" ]; then unset OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID; fi
# unset v2.0 items in case set
unset OS_TENANT_ID
unset OS_TENANT_NAME
# In addition to the owning entity (tenant), OpenStack stores the entity
# performing the action as the **user**.
export OS_USERNAME="USERNAME"
# With Keystone you pass the keystone password.
echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password for project $OS_PROJECT_NAME as user $OS_USERNAME: "
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
# If your configuration has multiple regions, we set that information here.
# OS_REGION_NAME is optional and only valid in certain environments.
export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
# Don't leave a blank variable, unset it if it was empty
if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
export OS_INTERFACE=public
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
```

First you need to create a `clouds.yaml` file. Take care of the indentation and
use spaces instead of tabs.

```yaml title="clouds.yaml"
clouds:
  openstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: <OS_AUTH_URL goes here>
      password: <OS_PASSWORD goes here, if not set, enter you password here>
      project_domain_name: <OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME goes here>
      project_name: <OS_PROJECT_NAME goes here>
      user_domain_name: <OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME goes here>
      username: <OS_USERNAME goes here>
   region_name: <OS_REGION_NAME goes here>
   identity_api_version: <OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION goes here>
   interface: <OS_INTERFACE goes here>
```

The final `clouds.yaml` for your `openrc` will then look like this one. The content
from the previous `PROJECT-openrc.sh` example was used here.

```yaml title="clouds.yaml"
clouds:
  openstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: https://api.testbed.osism.xyz:5000/v3
      password: PASSWORD
      project_domain_name: DOMAIN
      project_name: PROJECT
      user_domain_name: DOMAIN
      username: USERNAME
   region_name: RegionOne
   identity_api_version: 3
   interface: public
```

## With a script

### Python

```python title="clouds.py"
import os
import yaml

clouds = {
  "clouds":{
    "openstack": {
      "auth" : {
        "auth_url" : os.environ["OS_AUTH_URL"],
        "project_name": os.environ["OS_PROJECT_NAME"],
        "project_domain_name": os.environ["OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME"],
        "username": os.environ["OS_USERNAME"],
        "user_domain_name": os.environ["OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME"],
        "password": os.environ["OS_PASSWORD"],
      },
      "region_name": os.environ["OS_REGION_NAME"],
      "identity_api_version":  os.environ["OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION"],
      "interface": "public"
    }
  }
}

print(yaml.dump(clouds))
```

First you need to source your `openrc` file so that the `OS_` variables are available.

```
source PROJECT-openrc.sh
```

Now you can execute the Python script and a `clouds.yaml` will be written.

```
python3 clouds.py > clouds.yaml
```

### Bash

You need to point the `source` line to your `openrc` file first. Then execute the Bash script.
This will create the `clouds.yaml` file in your currect directory

```
#!/bin/bash

source PROJECT-openrc.sh

PROJECT_ID=$(openstack project list | grep $OS_PROJECT_NAME | awk '{print $2}')

cat << EOF > clouds.yaml
clouds:
  openstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: $OS_AUTH_URL
      username: "$OS_USERNAME"
      password: "$OS_PASSWORD"
      project_name: "$OS_PROJECT_NAME"
      project_id: "$PROJECT_ID"
      user_domain_name: "$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME"
    region_name: "$OS_REGION_NAME"
    interface: "public"
    identity_api_version: $OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION
EOF
```
