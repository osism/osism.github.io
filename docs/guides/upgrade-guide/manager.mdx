# Manager

:::warning

Always read the [release notes](https://osism.tech/docs/release-notes/) first to learn what has changed and what
adjustments are necessary. Read the release notes even if you are only updating from e.g. 7.0.2 to 7.0.5.

:::

The update of a manager service with a stable release of OSISM is described here.
In the example, OSISM release 7.0.5 is used.

1. Change the OSISM release in the configuration repository.

    1.1. Set the new OSISM version in the configuration repository.

         ```
         MANAGER_VERSION=7.0.5
         sed -i -e "s/manager_version: .*/manager_version: ${MANAGER_VERSION}/g" environments/manager/configuration.yml
         ```

    1.2. If `openstack_version` or `ceph_version` are set in `environments/manager/configuration.yml`
         (or anywhere else), they must be removed. If these are set, the stable release is not used for
         these components.


    1.3. Sync the image versions and files in the configuration repository.

         <Tabs>
         <TabItem value="osism-7" label="OSISM >= 7.0.0">
         ```
         make sync
         ```
         </TabItem>
         <TabItem value="osism-6" label="OSISM < 7.0.0">
         If Gilt is not installed via the `requirements.txt` of the manager environment it is
         important to use a version smaller v2. The v2 of Gilt is not yet usable.

         ```
         gilt overlay  # you have to do this 2x, this is not a copy & paste error
         gilt overlay
         ```

         Optionally, this is normally not necessary, it is possible to reference a specific tag of the
         [osism/cfg-generics](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics) repository. To do this, first
         check which version of osism/cfg-generics is used in a particular release. The version is
         defined in `generics_version` in the `base.yml` file in the `osism/release` repository. For OSISM 6.0.0,
         for example, this is version [v0.20230919.0](https://github.com/osism/release/blob/main/6.0.0/base.yml#L6).
         This version is then added to the file `gilt.yml` in the configuration repository instead of
         `main` at `version`. This change must be made again after each execution of `gilt overlay` as
         it is overwritten by the call of `gilt overlay`. This cannot be realized differently in the
         current implementation of [Gilt](https://github.com/retr0h/gilt).
         </TabItem>
         </Tabs>

    1.4. Commit and push all changes in the configuration repository. Since everyone here has their own
         workflows for changes to the configuration repository, only a generic example for Git.

         ```
         git commit -a -s -m "manager: use OSISM version 7.0.5"
         git push
         ```

2. Update the configuration repository on the manager node.

   ```
   osism apply configuration
   ```

3. Update the manager service on the manager node.

   ```
   osism update manager
   ```

   * If Ansible Vault was used to encrypt `environments/manager/secrets.yml`, the parameter
     `--ask-vault-pass` is also appended. From OSISM >= 8.0.0 this is no longer necessary.
   * If `osism update manager` does not work yet, use `osism-update-manager` instead.


4. Refresh the facts cache.

   ```
   osism apply facts
   ```

5. If Traefik is used on the manager node (`traefik_enable: true` in `environments/infrastructure/configuration.yml`)
   then Traefik should also be upgraded.

   ```
   osism apply traefik
   ```

6. Finally, the Ansible vault password must be made known again.

   ```
   osism set vault password
   ```
