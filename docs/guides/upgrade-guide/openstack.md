# OpenStack

:::info

When upgrade the different OpenStack services, all containers must be
restarted. When restarting the API services, there is a short downtime
of the APIs. This downtime is usually less than 1 minute.

:::

1. OpenStack client

   ```
   osism apply openstackclient
   ```

2. Keystone

   ```
   osism apply -a pull keystone
   osism apply -a upgrade keystone
   ```

3. Glance

   osism apply -a pull glance
   osism apply -a upgrade glance
   ```

   9.1. Update amphora image

   This step is only necessary if the Amphora Driver is used. If OVN is used as the driver,
   this step is not necessary.

   We provide regularly updated images for Octavia in
   [osism/openstack-octavia/amphora-image](https://github.com/osism/openstack-octavia-amphora-image).
   The OSISM CLI can be used to upload the correct image depending on the OpenStack release
   used.

   ```
   osism manage image octavia
   ```

   9.2. Amphora rotation

   This step is only necessary if the Amphora driver is used. If OVN is used as the driver,
   this step is not necessary.

10. Horizon

    ```
    osism apply -a pull horizon
    osism apply -a upgrade horizon
    ```
