# Concept Guide

:::info

The Concept Guide is currently under construction. Therefore, there are still
many empty sections that have already been created for the overall structure.
If there are requests for certain sections or if existing sections are not
understandable or need more details, please open an [issue](https://github.com/osism/issues/issues).
Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated. Open Source Software
and Documentation relies on contributions.
