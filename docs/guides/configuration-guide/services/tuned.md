# Tuned

The roller can be applied with `osism apply tuned`. The role is applied to all
compute nodes by default. This can be changed via the `hosts_tuned` parameter.

The profile to be used can be set via `tuned_profile`. By default, `virtual-host`
is used.

The following profiles are available:

| Profile                     | Description                                                                                                                       |
