# Ceph

The official Ceph documentation is located on https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/configuration/

It is **strongly advised** to use the documentation for the version being used.

* Pacific - https://docs.ceph.com/en/pacific/rados/configuration/
* Quincy - https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/rados/configuration/
* Reef - https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/rados/configuration/

## Unique Identifier

The File System ID is a unique identifier for the cluster.
The identifier is set via the parameter `fsid` in `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`
and must be unique. It can be generated with `uuidgen`.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
fsid: c2120a4a-669c-4769-a32c-b7e9d7b848f4
```

## Client

The `client.admin` keyring is placed in the file `environments/infrastructure/files/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring`.

## Swappiness

The swappiness is set via the `os_tuning_params` dictionary. The dictionary can
only be completely overwritten via an entry in the file `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`.

By default, the dictionary looks like this. If the swappiness of `10` is to be used, it is not
necessary to add the `os_tuning_params` dictionary to the configuration repository. This is only
necessary if the swappiness is to be customized.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
os_tuning_params:
  - { name: fs.file-max, value: 26234859 }
  - { name: vm.zone_reclaim_mode, value: 0 }
  - { name: vm.swappiness, value: 10 }
  - { name: vm.min_free_kbytes, value: "{{ vm_min_free_kbytes }}" }
```

The sysctl parameters are written to the file `/etc/sysctl.d/ceph-tuning.conf`
on the storage nodes.

```console
# cat /etc/sysctl.d/ceph-tuning.conf
fs.aio-max-nr=1048576
fs.file-max=26234859
vm.zone_reclaim_mode=0
vm.swappiness=10
vm.min_free_kbytes=4194303
```

## RGW service

1. Add following configuration in `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="osism-9" label="OSISM >= 9.0.0">
    ```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
    ceph_conf_overrides:
      "client.rgw.{{ rgw_zone }}.{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_hostname'] }}.rgw0":
        "rgw content length compat": "true"
        "rgw enable apis": "swift, s3, admin"
        "rgw keystone accepted roles": "member, admin"
        "rgw keystone accepted admin roles": "admin"
        "rgw keystone admin domain": "default"
        "rgw keystone admin password": "{{ ceph_rgw_keystone_password }}"
        "rgw keystone admin project": "service"
        "rgw keystone admin tenant": "service"
        "rgw keystone admin user": "ceph_rgw"
        "rgw keystone api version": "3"
        "rgw keystone url": "https://api-int.testbed.osism.xyz:5000"
        "rgw keystone verify ssl": "false"
        "rgw keystone implicit tenants": "true"
        "rgw s3 auth use keystone": "true"
        "rgw swift account in url": "true"
        "rgw swift versioning enabled": "true"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="osism-8" label="OSISM < 9.0.0">
    ```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
    ceph_conf_overrides:
      "client.rgw.{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_hostname'] }}.rgw0":
        "rgw content length compat": "true"
        "rgw enable apis": "swift, s3, admin"
        "rgw keystone accepted roles": "member, admin"
        "rgw keystone accepted admin roles": "admin"
        "rgw keystone admin domain": "default"
        "rgw keystone admin password": "{{ ceph_rgw_keystone_password }}"
        "rgw keystone admin project": "service"
        "rgw keystone admin tenant": "service"
        "rgw keystone admin user": "ceph_rgw"
        "rgw keystone api version": "3"
        "rgw keystone url": "https://api-int.testbed.osism.xyz:5000"
        "rgw keystone verify ssl": "false"
        "rgw keystone implicit tenants": "true"
        "rgw s3 auth use keystone": "true"
        "rgw swift account in url": "true"
        "rgw swift versioning enabled": "true"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    If the `ceph_conf_overrides` parameter already exists in `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`,
    expand it and do not overwrite it.

    If self-signed SSL certificates are used, two additional parameters must be set.

    ```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
     "rgw keystone verify ssl": "false"
     "rgw verify ssl": "false"
    ```

    For all possible configuration parameters visit the
    [Ceph configuration reference](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/radosgw/config-ref/).

2. Add the `ceph_rgw_keystone_password` from `environments/kolla/secrets.yml` to
   `environments/ceph/secrets.yml`.

3. Add following configuration in `environments/kolla/configuration.yml`

    ```yaml title="environments/kolla/configuration.yml"
    enable_ceph_rgw: true
    enable_ceph_rgw_keystone: true

    ceph_rgw_swift_compatibility: false
    ceph_rgw_swift_account_in_url: true
    ```

4. On the nodes on which the RGW service is to be deployed, `radosgw_interface` **or**
   `radosgw_address` must be set in the host vars for the nodes in the inventory.
   If `radosgw_interface` is used, the first IPv4 address on this interface is used.

    ```yaml title=inventory/host_vars/testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz/vars.yml
    ##########################################################
    # ceph

    radosgw_address: 192.168.16.10
    ```

5. The nodes on which the RGW service is to be deployed can be defined in inventory group
   `ceph-rgw`. By default, the RGW services are deployed on the Ceph control nodes..

    ```ini title="inventory/20-roles"
    [ceph-rgw:children]
    ceph-control
    ```

## Pools and Keys

The defaults for pools are defined in the [osism/defaults](https://github.com/osism/defaults/blob/main/all/099-ceph.yml)
repository:

| Parameter                                  | Default value     |
|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------|
| `openstack_pool_default_min_size`          | 0                 |
| `openstack_pool_default_pg_autoscale_mode` | false             |
| `openstack_pool_default_pg_num`            | 64                |
| `openstack_pool_default_rule_name`         | `replicated_rule` |
| `openstack_pool_default_size`              | 3                 |

:::warning

The autoscaler for pools is not enabled by default and the number of PGs used when creating
a pool is very low. Either you enable the autoscaler by default or you have to
[adjust the number of PGs](../../operations-guide/ceph/index.md#set-number-of-pgs-for-a-pool)
accordingly after the initial creation of the pools.

:::

### Extra pools

Extra pools can be defined via the `openstack_pools_extra` parameter.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
openstack_extra001_pool:
  name: extra001
  pg_num: "{{ openstack_pool_default_pg_num }}"
  pgp_num: "{{ openstack_pool_default_pg_num }}"
  rule_name: "replicated_rule"
  type: 1
  erasure_profile: ""
  expected_num_objects: ""
  application: "rbd"
  size: "{{ openstack_pool_default_size }}"
  min_size: "{{ openstack_pool_default_min_size }}"
  pg_autoscale_mode: "{{ openstack_pool_default_pg_autoscale_mode }}"

openstack_pools_extra:
  - "{{ openstack_extra001_pool }}"
```

If more than one Ceph cluster is managed with one manager, do not place the
parameters in `environments/ceph/configuration.yml` but in a corresponding file.

The extra pools can then be created by calling `osism apply ceph-pools`.

### Extra keys

Extra keys can be defined via the `openstack_keys_extra` parameter.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
openstack_extra001_key:
  - name: client.extra001
    caps:
      mon: "profile rbd"
      osd: "profile rbd pool={{ openstack_extra001_pool.name }}"
    mode: "0600"

openstack_keys_extra:
  - "{{ openstack_extra001_key }}"
```

The key is also added in the manager environment to copy it to the correct location.

```yaml title="environments/manager/configuration.yml"
ceph_custom_keys:
  - src: ceph.client.extra001.keyring
    dest: "{{ configuration_directory }}/environments/infrastructure/files/ceph/ceph.client.extra001.keyring"
```

The extra keys can then be created by calling `osism apply ceph-pools`.

The extra keys can then be fetched and copied by calling `osism apply ceph-copy-keys`.

## OSD devices

1. For each Ceph storage node edit the file `inventory/host_vars/<nodename>.yml`
   add a configuration like the following to it. Ensure that no `devices` parameter
   is present in the file.

    1. Parameters

        * With the optional parameter `ceph_osd_db_wal_devices_buffer_space_percent` it is possible to
          set the percentage of VGs to leave free. The parameter is not set by default. Can be helpful
          for SSD performance of some older SSD models or to extend lifetime of SSDs in general.

          ```yaml
          ceph_osd_db_wal_devices_buffer_space_percent: 10
          ```
        * It is possible to configure the devices to be used with the parameters `ceph_osd_devices`,
          `ceph_db_devices`, `ceph_wal_devices`, and `ceph_db_wal_devices`. This is described below.
        * It is always possible to use device names such as `sda` or device IDs such as
          `disk/by-id/wwn-<something>` or `disk/by-id/nvme-eui.<something>`. `/dev/` is not
          prefixed and is added automatically.
        * The `db_size` parameter is optional and defaults to `(VG size - buffer space (if enabled)) / num_osds`.
        * The `wal_size` parameter is optional and defaults to `2 GB`.
        * The `num_osds` parameter specifies the maximum number of OSDs that can be assigned to a WAL device or DB device.
        * The optional parameter `wal_pv` can be used to set the device that is to be used as the WAL device.
        * The optional parameter `db_pv` can be used to set the device that is to be used as the DB device.

    2. OSD only

        The `sda` device will be used as an OSD device without WAL and DB device.

        ```yaml
        ceph_osd_devices:
          sda:
        ```

    3. OSD + DB device

        The `nvme0n1` device will be used as an DB device. It is possible to use this DB device for up to 6 OSDs. Each
        OSD is provided with 30 GB.

        ```yaml
        ceph_db_devices:
          nvme0n1:
            num_osds: 6
            db_size: 30 GB
        ```

        The `sda` device will be used as an OSD device with `nvme0n1` as DB device.

        ```yaml
        ceph_osd_devices:
           sda:
             db_pv: nvme0n1
        ```

    4. OSD + WAL device

        The `nvme0n1` device will be used as an WAL device. It is possible to use this WAL device for up to 6 OSDs. Each
        OSD is provided with 2 GB.

        ```yaml
        ceph_wal_devices:
          nvme0n1:
            num_osds: 6
            wal_size: 2 GB
        ```

        The `sda` device will be used as an OSD device with `nvme0n1` as WAL device.

        ```yaml
        ceph_osd_devices:
           sda:
             wal_pv: nvme0n1
        ```

    5. OSD + DB device + WAL device (same device for DB + WAL)

        The `nvme0n1` device will be used as an DB device and a WAL device. It is possible to use those devices for up
        to 6 OSDs.

        ```yaml
        ceph_db_wal_devices:
          nvme0n1:
            num_osds: 6
            db_size: 30 GB
            wal_size: 2 GB
        ```

        The `sda` device will be used as an OSD device with `nvme0n1` as DB device and `nvme0n1` as WAL device.

        ```yaml
        ceph_osd_devices:
           sda:
             db_pv: nvme0n1
             wal_pv: nvme0n1
        ```

    6. OSD + DB device + WAL device (different device for DB + WAL)

        The `nvme0n1` device will be used as an DB device. It is possible to use this DB device for up to 6 OSDs. Each
        OSD is provided with 30 GB.

        ```yaml
        ceph_db_devices:
          nvme0n1:
            num_osds: 6
            db_size: 30 GB
        ```

        The `nvme1n1` device will be used as an WAL device. It is possible to use this WAL device for up to 6 OSDs. Each
        OSD is provided with 2 GB.

        ```yaml
        ceph_wal_devices:
          nvme1n1:
            num_osds: 6
            wal_size: 2 GB
        ```

        The `sda` device will be used as an OSD device with `nvme0n1` as DB device and `nvme1n1` as WAL device.

        ```yaml
        ceph_osd_devices:
           sda:
             db_pv: nvme0n1
             wal_pv: nvme1n1
        ```

2. Push the configuration to your configuration repository and after that do the following

    ```bash
    osism apply configuration
    osism reconciler sync
    osism apply facts
    ```

3. After the configuration has been pulled and facts updated,
   you can run the LVM configuration playbook:

    ```bash
    osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes
    ```

    This will generate a new configuration file for each node in `/tmp`
    on the first manager node named `<nodename>-ceph-lvm-configuration.yml`.

4. Take the generated configuration file from `/tmp` and **replace the previously
   configuration** for each node.

    In this example, the following content was in the host vars file before
    `osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes` was called.

    ```yaml
    ceph_osd_devices:
      sdb:
      sdc:
    ```

    The following content has now been generated in the file in the `/tmp` directory by running
    `osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes`.

    ```yaml
    ceph_osd_devices:
      sdb:
        osd_lvm_uuid: 196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb
      sdc:
        osd_lvm_uuid: c6df96be-1264-5815-9cb2-da5eb453a6de
    lvm_volumes:
    - data: osd-block-196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb
      data_vg: ceph-196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb
    - data: osd-block-c6df96be-1264-5815-9cb2-da5eb453a6de
      data_vg: ceph-c6df96be-1264-5815-9cb2-da5eb453a6de
    ```

    This content from the file in the `/tmp` directory is added in the host vars file.
    The previous `ceph_osd_devices` is replaced with the new content.

5. Push the updated configuration **again** to your configuration repository and re-run:

    ```bash
    osism apply configuration
    osism reconciler sync
    ```

6. Finally create the LVM devices.

    ```bash
    osism apply ceph-create-lvm-devices
    ```

    These PVs, VGs and LVs are created using the example from step 4.

    ```console
    $ sudo pvs
    PV         VG                                        Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree
    /dev/sdb   ceph-196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb lvm2 a--  <20.00g    0

    $ sudo lvs

    osd-block-196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb ceph-196aad32-7cc4-5350-8a45-1b03f50fc9bb -wi-a----- <20.00g
    osd-block-c6df96be-1264-5815-9cb2-da5eb453a6de ceph-c6df96be-1264-5815-9cb2-da5eb453a6de -wi-a----- <20.00g
    ```

7. Everything is now ready for the deployment of the OSDs.
   Details on deploying Ceph in the [Ceph Deploy Guide](../../deploy-guide/services/ceph/index.mdx).

### Full examples

#### Use of dedicated DB devices

The `ceph_osd_devices` and `ceph_db_devices` parameters with the following content are initially added
in the host vars of the node. Devices `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` are used as OSD devices. The device `/dev/sdd`
is used as a DB device for up to 2 OSDs. For each OSD that uses `/dev/sdd` as DB device, an LV volume of
(in this case) 30 GByte is created. Please note that at least 30 GByte must be used for a DB device in production.

```yaml
ceph_db_devices:
  sdd:
    num_osds: 2
    db_size: 30 GB

ceph_osd_devices:
  sdb:
    db_pv: sdd
  sdc:
    db_pv: sdd
```

Then generate the required LVM2 device configuration with the `ceph-configure-lvm-volumes` play.

```bash
osism apply facts
osism reconciler sync
osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes
```

Check the `/tmp` directory on the manager node for files like `testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz-ceph-lvm-configuration.yml`.
Add this content to the host vars of the corresponding node. The existing `ceph_osd_devices` parameter is replaced.

```yaml
---
#
# This is Ceph LVM configuration for testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz
# generated by ceph-configure-lvm-volumes playbook.
#
ceph_db_devices:
  sdd:
    db_size: 30 GB
    num_osds: 2
    vg_name: ceph-db-eb7522b1-41cf-522e-8d7e-2a4a82a879bb
ceph_osd_devices:
  sdb:
    db_pv: sdd
    osd_lvm_uuid: 75960289-2e0e-525d-8bb5-dd8552531ef5
  sdc:
    db_pv: sdd
    osd_lvm_uuid: ce2c2cb6-f911-52dd-b57f-4476bf7afe9f
lvm_volumes:
- data: osd-block-75960289-2e0e-525d-8bb5-dd8552531ef5
  data_vg: ceph-75960289-2e0e-525d-8bb5-dd8552531ef5
  db: osd-db-75960289-2e0e-525d-8bb5-dd8552531ef5
  db_vg: ceph-db-eb7522b1-41cf-522e-8d7e-2a4a82a879bb
- data: osd-block-ce2c2cb6-f911-52dd-b57f-4476bf7afe9f
  data_vg: ceph-ce2c2cb6-f911-52dd-b57f-4476bf7afe9f
  db: osd-db-ce2c2cb6-f911-52dd-b57f-4476bf7afe9f
  db_vg: ceph-db-eb7522b1-41cf-522e-8d7e-2a4a82a879bb
```

Finally, create the necessary PVs, VGs and LVs. The parameter `-e ignore_db_too_small=true` is only set
here in the example because we use less than 30 GByte for the size of the DB LV.

```bash
osism reconciler sync
osism apply ceph-create-lvm-devices -e ignore_db_too_small=true
```

You can check the PVs, VGs, and LVs on the node.

```console
$ sudo pvs

#### Use of partitions

The use of partitions presented in this example is not recommended for use in production but only for POCs.

First create partitions that should be used for Ceph. In this example we use a block device `/dev/sdb`
with four partitions that will be used for Ceph OSDs.

```console
$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb
Disk /dev/sdb: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Disk model: QEMU HARDDISK
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 709B8C6C-51E1-4644-9ED4-0604607FCCEE

Device        Start      End  Sectors Size Type
/dev/sdb1      2048 10487807 10485760   5G Linux filesystem
/dev/sdb2  10487808 20973567 10485760   5G Linux filesystem
/dev/sdb3  20973568 31459327 10485760   5G Linux filesystem
/dev/sdb4  31459328 41943006 10483679   5G Linux filesystem
```

The `ceph_osd_devices` parameter with the following content is initially added in the host vars of the node.
The partitions `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/sdc1` and `/dev/sdd1`, are to be used as OSD.

```yaml
ceph_osd_devices:
  sdb1:
  sdb2:
  sdb3:
  sdb4:
```

Then generate the required LVM2 device configuration with the `ceph-configure-lvm-volumes` play.

```bash
osism apply facts
osism reconciler sync
osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes
```

Check the `/tmp` directory on the manager node for files like `testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz-ceph-lvm-configuration.yml`.
Add this content to the host vars of the corresponding node. The existing `ceph_osd_devices` parameter is replaced.

```yaml
---
#
# This is Ceph LVM configuration for testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz
# generated by ceph-configure-lvm-volumes playbook.
#
ceph_osd_devices:
  sdb1:
    osd_lvm_uuid: 9e8799ae-c716-5212-8833-49f153ffbcef
  sdb2:
    osd_lvm_uuid: 8518d3a2-3194-5764-b55a-c51222b9b576
  sdb3:
    osd_lvm_uuid: a0da232a-e5b8-5823-8c42-8fb231442edc
  sdb4:
    osd_lvm_uuid: 56f7b5bc-82b0-5626-90a5-adf6078ceba6
lvm_volumes:

  data_vg: ceph-56f7b5bc-82b0-5626-90a5-adf6078ceba6
```

Finally, create the necessary PVs, VGs and LVs.

```bash
osism reconciler sync
osism apply ceph-create-lvm-devices
```

You can check the PVs, VGs, and LVs on the node.

```console
$ sudo pvs

```

### Add a new osd

1. There is the following existing configuration in `inventory/host_vars/<nodename>.yml`.

    ```yaml
    ceph_osd_devices:
      sda:
        osd_lvm_uuid: 71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      sdb:
        osd_lvm_uuid: acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
    lvm_volumes:
    - data: osd-block-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      data_vg: ceph-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
    - data: osd-block-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
      data_vg: ceph-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
    ```

2. The block device `sdc` should be added as new OSD on `nodename`. Edit the existing
   configuration in `inventory/host_vars/<nodename>.yml` and add `sdc` to the list
   `ceph_osd_devices`.

    ```yaml
    ceph_osd_devices:
      sda:
        osd_lvm_uuid: 71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      sdb:
        osd_lvm_uuid: acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
      sdc:
    lvm_volumes:
    - data: osd-block-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      data_vg: ceph-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
    - data: osd-block-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
      data_vg: ceph-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
    ```

3. Commit changes in the configuration repository, sync the configuration repository on
   the manager and reconcile the inventory with `osism reconciler sync`.

4. Regenerate the configuration with `osism apply ceph-configure-lvm-volumes -l <nodename>`.
   Synchronize the contents of `/tmp/<nodename>-ceph-lvm-configuration.yml` with those in
   `inventory/host_vars/<nodename>.yml`.

    ```yaml
    ceph_osd_devices:
      sda:
        osd_lvm_uuid: 71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      sdb:
        osd_lvm_uuid: acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
      sdc:
        osd_lvm_uuid: ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
    lvm_volumes:
    - data: osd-block-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
      data_vg: ceph-71e54cfb-65e5-5109-8f09-2be6b661f39c
    - data: osd-block-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
      data_vg: ceph-acb56e1f-0700-587f-95d4-fbe905491fea
    - data: osd-block-ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
      data_vg: ceph-ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
    ```

    Added in this case:

    ```yaml
    [...]
      sdc:
        osd_lvm_uuid: ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
    [...]
    - data: osd-block-ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
      data_vg: ceph-ad1a16cd-b35e-58d1-8e40-80a14597f583
    ```

5. Commit changes in the configuration repository, sync the configuration repository on
   the manager and reconcile the inventory with `osism reconciler sync`.

6. Create new LVM devices.

    ```bash
    osism apply ceph-create-lvm-devices -l <nodename>
    ```

7. Everything is now ready for the deployment of the new OSD.
   Details on deploying the OSD service in the [Ceph operations guide](../../operations-guide/ceph#add-a-new-osd).

## Dashboard

Password for the admin user of the Ceph dashboard is set via `ceph_dashboard_password`.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/secrets.yml"
ceph_dashboard_password: password
```

User name of the admin user, port and listen IP address can be set via additional parameters.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
ceph_dashboard_addr: 0.0.0.0
ceph_dashboard_port: 7000
ceph_dashboard_username: admin
```

The Ceph dashboard is bootstrapped with the `ceph-bootstrap-dashboard` play.

```bash
osism apply ceph-bootstrap-dashboard
```

### Configuring the openstack loadbalancer to expose the ceph dashboard

The ceph dashboard runs in an active/standby configuration. In its default standby instances will
redirect to the active instance. Most deployments will want to use the openstack loadbalancer to
expose the ceph dashboard on the internal network and direct traffic directly to the active
instance.

In this scenario the dashboard should be configured to return an http error with status `404` on
standby instances.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
ceph_dashboard_standby_behaviour: error
ceph_dashboard_standby_error_status_code: 404
```

Create a loadbalancer configuration

```jinja2 title="environments/kolla/files/overlays/haproxy/services.d/ceph_dashboard.cfg"

{%- set internal_tls_bind_info = 'ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certificates/haproxy-internal.pem' if kolla_enable_tls_internal|bool else '' %}

listen ceph_dashboard
  option httpchk
  http-check expect status 200,404
  http-check disable-on-404
  {{ "bind %s:%s %s"|e|format(kolla_internal_vip_address, 8140, internal_tls_bind_info)|trim() }}
{% for host in groups['ceph-mgr'] %}
  server {{ hostvars[host]['ansible_facts']['hostname'] }} {{ hostvars[host]['monitor_address'] }}:7000 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
{% endfor %}
```

and apply it.

```bash
osism apply -a reconfigure loadbalancer
```

## Second Ceph cluster

With OSISM, it is possible to manage any number of independent Ceph clusters via a single OSISM
manager service using sub-environments. A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory
below the `environments` directory of the configuration repository with a special name.

A sub-environment for Ceph always has the name `ceph.NAME`. The `ceph.NAME` directory in the
configuration repository then contains the `configuration.yml`, `images.yml` and `secrets.yml`
files as usual.

In this example, a sub-environment `ceph.rgw` is created which is used for a Ceph cluster that
will only be used as an RGW cluster.

In comparison to the normal `ceph` environment, the groups to be used must be overwritten for a
Ceph sub-environment. In this case, two groups are defined: `ceph.rgw` and `ceph.rgw.empty`.
Any other groups can be used, e.g. `ceph.rgw.osd`. It is recommended to base the name of the
groups on the name of the sub-environments.

The `ceph.rgw.empty` group is important because there are plays in ceph-ansible that are executed
when nodes are in a specific group. To explicitly avoid this, certain groups are set to the empty
group.

All available group name parameters are listed in the [[099-ceph.yml]](https://github.com/osism/defaults/blob/main/all/099-ceph.yml)
file of the [osism/defaults](https://github.com/osism/defaults) repository.

```yaml title="environments/ceph.rgw/configuration.yml"
##########################
# groups

ceph_group_name: ceph.rgw

client_group_name: ceph.rgw
grafana_server_group_name: ceph.rgw
iscsi_gw_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
mds_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
mgr_group_name: ceph.rgw
mon_group_name: ceph.rgw
nfs_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
osd_group_name: ceph.rgw
rbdmirror_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
restapi_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
rgw_group_name: ceph.rgw
rgwloadbalancer_group_name: ceph.rgw.empty
```

The groups used are then added in the inventory in the `10-custom` file.

```ini title="inventory/10-custom"
[ceph.rgw]
testbed-node-3.testbed.osism.xyz
testbed-node-4.testbed.osism.xyz
testbed-node-5.testbed.osism.xyz

[ceph.rgw.empty]
```

The sub environment can then be specified with all `apply` commands of the OSISM CLI. For example,
to deploy the Ceph mon services of the `ceph.rgw` sub environment:

```bash
osism apply --sub rgw ceph-osds
```

## Resource limits

Resource limits for the individual Ceph services can be set via `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`.
The possible parameters and their defaults for memory limits and CPU limits are listed below.

* Memory limits

  ```yaml
  ceph_mds_docker_memory_limit: "{{ ansible_facts['memtotal_mb'] }}m"
  ceph_mgr_docker_memory_limit: "{{ ansible_facts['memtotal_mb'] }}m"
  ceph_mon_docker_memory_limit: "{{ ansible_facts['memtotal_mb'] }}m"
  ceph_osd_docker_memory_limit: "{{ ansible_facts['memtotal_mb'] }}m"
  ceph_rbd_mirror_docker_memory_limit: "{{ ansible_facts['memtotal_mb'] }}m"
  ceph_rgw_docker_memory_limit: "4096m"
  ```

* CPU limits

  ```yaml
  ceph_mds_docker_cpu_limit: 4
  ceph_mgr_docker_cpu_limit: 1
  ceph_mon_docker_cpu_limit: 1
  ceph_osd_docker_cpu_limit: 4
  ceph_rbd_mirror_docker_cpu_limit: 1
  ceph_rgw_docker_cpu_limit: 8
  ```

## CPU Pinning

CPU pinning and specifying the NUMA nodes to be used for the Ceph OSD and RGW services can be
set via `environments/ceph/configuration.yml`.
The possible parameters and possible values are listed below. The parameters are not enabled
by default.

* Limit the specific CPUs or cores a container can use. A comma-separated list or
  hyphen-separated range of CPUs a container can use, if you have more than one CPU.
  The first CPU is numbered 0. A valid value might be 0-3 (to use the first, second,
  third, and fourth CPU) or 1,3 (to use the second and fourth CPU).

  ```yaml
  # ceph_osd_docker_cpuset_cpus: "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16"
  # ceph_rgw_docker_cpuset_cpus: "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16"
  ```

* Memory nodes in which to allow execution (e.g. 0-3, 0,1). Only effective on NUMA systems.

  ```yaml
  # ceph_osd_docker_cpuset_mems: "0"
  # ceph_rgw_docker_cpuset_mems: "0"
  ```

  Available NUMA nodes on a node can be displayed with [numactl](https://github.com/numactl/numactl).
  In this example, there are 2 NUMA nodes. The pinned CPUs should all be assigned to the
  specified NUMA node.

  ```console
  # numactl --hardware
  available: 2 nodes (0-1)
  node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59
  node 0 size: 515581 MB
  node 0 free: 511680 MB
  node 1 cpus: 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79
  node 1 size: 516078 MB
  node 1 free: 511865 MB
  node distances:
  node   0   1
    0:  10  20
    1:  20  10
  ```

## Use of RBDs for nodes

1. Add an extra pool (see [Extra pools](#extra-pools)).

2. Add a key for the new pool (see [Extra keys](#extra-keys)).

3. Add nodes on which RBDs are to be used to the inventory group `cephclient`. The file
   `99-overwrite` must be used for this. By default, the inventory group looks like this:

   ```ini file="inventory/99-overwrite"
   [cephclient:children]
   manager
   ```

   It could look like this with the additional inventory group:

   ```ini file="inventory/99-overwrite"
   [cephclient:children]
   manager
   testbed-resource-nodes
   ```

4. Prepare the configuration of the Ceph client. Get the keyring with
   `ceph auth get client.extra001`.

  ```yaml file="inventory/group_vars/testbed-resource-nodes.yml"
  ---
  cephclient_install_type: package
  cephclient_keyring_name: client.extra001
  cephclient_keyring: |
    [client.extra001]
        key = AQBiHV9nAAAAABAAhtxl8rdW/EBvxiOGw4iMJw==
        caps mon = "profile rbd"
        caps osd = "profile rbd pool=extra001"
  ```

  For Ubuntu 24.04 nodes also add the following parameter. At the moment no Ceph packages
  are available for Ubuntu 24.04.

  ```yaml
  cephclient_debian_repository: "deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-{{ cephclient_version }} jammy main"
  ```

5. Create new RBD in the new pool (run this command on the manager node).
   In this example, the name of the node on which the RBD is to be used is
   used as the name for the RBD.

   ```bash
   rbd create testbed-node-5 --size 64 --pool extra001
   ```

6. On the node map the RBD as block device.

   ```bash
   sudo rbd map testbed-node-5 --pool extra001 --id extra001
   ```

7. On the node check the mapped block device.

   ```console
   sudo rbd showmapped --id extra001
   id  pool      namespace  image           snap  device
   0   extra001             testbed-node-5  -     /dev/rbd0
   ```

8. Done. `/dev/rbd0` can now be used like a normal block device.

9. The file `/etc/ceph/rbdmap` is used to persist the mapping. The service `rbdmap.service`
