# Manager

## Stable release

:::warning

Always read the [release notes](https://osism.tech/docs/release-notes/) first to learn what has changed and what
adjustments are necessary. Read the release notes even if you are only updating from e.g. 7.0.2 to 7.0.5.

:::

In the example, OSISM release 7.0.5 is used.

1. Set the new manager version in the configuration repository.

   ```
   MANAGER_VERSION="7.0.5"
   sed -i "~s,^manager_version:.*\$,manager_version: ${MANAGER_VERSION}," environments/manager/configuration.yml
   ```

2. If `openstack_version` or `ceph_version` are set in `environments/manager/configuration.yml`
   (or anywhere else), they must be removed. If these are set, the stable release is not used for
   these components.

3. Sync the image versions in the configuration repository.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="osism-7" label="OSISM >= 7.0.0">
   ```
   make sync
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="osism-6" label="OSISM < 7.0.0">
   If Gilt is not installed via the `requirements.txt` of the manager environment it is
   important to use a version smaller v2. The v2 of Gilt is not yet usable.
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
     gilt overlay && gilt overlay
   ```

   Optionally, this is normally not necessary, it is possible to reference a specific tag of the
   [osism/cfg-generics](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics) repository. To do this, first
   check which version of osism/cfg-generics is used in a particular release. The version is
   defined in `generics_version` in the `base.yml` file in the `osism/release` repository. For OSISM 6.0.0,
   for example, this is version [v0.20230919.0](https://github.com/osism/release/blob/main/6.0.0/base.yml#L6).
   This version is then added to the file `gilt.yml` in the configuration repository instead of
   `main` at `version`. This change must be made again after each execution of `gilt overlay` as
   it is overwritten by the call of `gilt overlay`. This cannot be realized differently in the
   current implementation of [Gilt](https://github.com/retr0h/gilt).
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. Commit and push changes in the configuration repository. Since everyone here has their own
   workflows for changes to the configuration repository, only a generic example for Git.

   ```
   git commit -a -s -m "manager: use OSISM version ${MANAGER_VERSION?}"
   git push
   ```

## Working with Git branches

For example, for compliance and security reasons, many organizations prefer to prepare changes to
production systems on dedicated Git branches, roll them out to the production environment
using the 4-eyes control principle and then finally transfer them to the `main` branch through a
review and release process.

A typical scenario is the [Manager Upgrade](../upgrade-guide/manager.mdx).

OSISM offers the option of using specific Git branches on the manager.

The Git branch can be changed in the following way:

1. Create a branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-FOR-CHANGE-XYZ
   ```

2. Set the branch name of your deployment branch with the variable `configuration_git_version` in `configuration.yml`.
   This needs always to be changed on the manager node later if you merge the current branch to another target branch.

   ```bash
   BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
   sed -i "~s,^configuration_git_version:.*\$,configuration_git_version: ${BRANCH}," environments/configuration.yml
   git commit -m "Starting to work on #<issue-id>" -s environment/configuration.yml
   git push
   ```

3. Login to the manager and activate the branch
   (not needed when performing a initial manager install)

   ```bash
   cd /opt/configuration
   git fetch
   git checkout YOUR-BRANCH-FOR-CHANGE-XYZ
   osism apply configuration
   ```

4. *Recommended:* Rebuild inventories and update facts
   (On changing branches there are oft potential changes in the inventory structure)

   ```
   osism reconciler sync
   osism apply facts
   ```

5. Start your work on the topic and perfom a final review when the topic is complete

## OpenSearch integration

With the command `osism log opensearch` it is possible to send SQL queries
to the OpenSearch service. For the command to be functional, the OpenSearch
integration must be activated in the manager environment and the OpenSearch
address and port must be set.

```yaml title="environments/manager/configuration.yml"
manager_opensearch_enable: true
manager_opensearch_address: api-int.testbed.osism.xyz
manager_opensearch_port: 9200
manager_opensearch_protocol: https
```

The integration can also be enabled later. `osism update manager` is then
executed after the configuration has been changed.

## OpenStack broker integration

If the Baremetal Service Integration in OSISM is used, the OpenStack Broker integration is
required. The integration itself is activated by setting the parameter `enable_listener` to `true`.

The hosts in the `manager_listener_broker_hosts` list are the control nodes of OpenStack.
The user is set via `manager_listener_broker_username`. On OpenStack's RabbitMQ broker, the user `openstack`
is present by default.

```yaml title="environments/manager/configuration.yml"
enable_listener: true
manager_listener_broker_hosts:
  - 192.168.16.10
  - 192.168.16.11
  - 192.168.16.12
manager_listener_broker_username: openstack
manager_listener_broker_uri: "{% for host in manager_listener_broker_hosts %}amqp://{{ manager_listener_broker_username }}:{{ manager_listener_broker_password }}@{{ host }}:5672/{% if not loop.last %};{% endif %}{% endfor %}"
```

The password used when using the `openstack` user is `rabbitmq_password` from `environments/kolla/secrets.yml`.

```yaml title="environments/manager/secrets.yml"
manager_listener_broker_password: RABBITMQ_PASSWORD
```
