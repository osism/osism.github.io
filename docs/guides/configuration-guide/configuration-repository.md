# Configuration Repository

The configuration required for an OSISM managed cluster is stored in a single Git
monorepo, the configuration repository.

## Creating a new configuration repository

The initial content for this configuration repository is generated using the
[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter).

Cookiecutter generates a simple initial configuration for your new cluster by prompting
you for the basic details of the new cluster.

The configuration repository is not created on the future Manager node. It is created on a
local workstation. If the local workstation cannot be used for this purpose, a dedicated
virtual system can be used. For more information on this topic, refer to the
[Seed Deploy Guide](../deploy-guide/seed.md)..

### Step 1: Preparation

First decide where to store your Git repository The content generated by the cookiecutter in
the `output/configuration` directory is committed to a new Git repository. By default, the
configuration repository is assumed to be on GitHub. This can also be GitLab or an internal
Git service as well.

Host and path to the Git repository are specified by the `git_` parameters. These are
requested in step 2. The `git_` parameters do not specify the path to the cookiecutter
to use.

```
  [8/20] git_host (github.com):
  [9/20] git_port (22):
  [10/20] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY): regiocloud/configuration
  [11/20] git_username (git):
  [12/20] git_version (main):
```

In this case, the generated configuration in the `output/configuration` directory is
stored on GitHub in the `regiocloud/configuration` repository.

See the [parameter reference](#parameter-reference) for more details. The parameters
listed there will be queried during the execution of Cookiecutter.

### Step 2: Run Cookiecutter

In this example a new configuration repository is created with the default settings. The latest stable
version of OSISM is used. The use of latest is described in the section [Using latest](#using-latest).

1. The directory `output` is created and used as output volume. It is only necessary to create the empty
   directory.

   ```
   mkdir output
   ```

2. The Cookiecutter runs inside a container. [Docker must be usable on the system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   where the Cookiecutter will be used. It should also work with Podman.

   ```
   docker run \
     -e TARGET_UID="$(id -u)" \
     -e TARGET_GID="$(id -g)" \
     -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
     --rm -it quay.io/osism/cookiecutter
   ```

3. A few parameters are requested. The parameters are documented in detail in the [Parameters reference](#parameters-reference).

   ```
   [1/19] with_ceph (1):
   [2/19] with_keycloak (0):
   [3/19] ceph_network(192.168.64.0/19):
   [4/19] ceph_version (quincy):
   [5/19] domain (osism.xyz):
   [6/19] fqdn_external (api.osism.xyz):
   [7/19] fqdn_internal (api-int.osism.xyz):
   [8/19] git_host (github.com):
   [9/19] git_port (22):
   [10/19] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY):
   [11/19] git_username (git):
   [12/19] git_version (main):
   [13/19] ip_external (192.168.96.9):
   [14/19] ip_internal (192.168.32.9):
   [15/19] manager_version (7.0.4):
   [16/19] name_server (149.112.112.112):
   [17/19] ntp_server (de.pool.ntp.org):
   [18/19] openstack_version (2023.2):
   [19/19] project_name (configuration):
   ```

### Step 3: Upload the new configuration to the remote git repository

Add the initial configuration state to the repository. How to add a deploy key on GitHub is documented in
[Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys).
Read permissions are sufficient.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY.git YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cp -r output/configuration/{*,.gitignore} YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cd YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit after bootstrap"
$ git push
```

The content is now committed to the Git repository that was created earlier in the process.

:::warning

The `secrets` directory is not stored in the Git repository. Its contents can be
stored in a trusted location.

The `secrets` directory contains an SSH key pair which is used as the deploy key to
make the configuration repository available on the manager node later. Write access
is not required. The public SSH key is stored in the `secrets/id_rsa.configuration.pub` file.

:::

### Step 4: Post-processing of the generated configuration

The configuration repository that is initially created with the Cookiecutter is not immediately usable.
For example, the inventory needs to be built. All other information can be found in the
[Configuration Guide](../configuration-guide/).

The password for Ansible Vault encrypted files, is stored in `secrets/vaultpass`.
The password of the generated Keepass file is `password`. This should be changed when using the Keepass file.

Use git to version all your configuration changes.

### Using latest

If you want to use the latest version, this is done using the `manager_version` parameter. By default,
this is always set to the latest stable version.

```
manager_version [7.0.0]: latest
```

If the `manager_version` parameter is set to `latest` it is also possible to explicitly
set the `openstack_version` and the `ceph_version` explicitly..

## Configuration repository layout

A configuration repository always has the same basic layout. This section describes
the content available in a configuration repository. In the section
[Creating a new configuration repository](#creating-a-new-configuration-repository) is the creation
of a new configuration repository documented.

* `environments` directory
* `inventory` directory
* `netbox` directory (optional)
* `requirements.txt` file

  In the `requirements.txt` the necessary dependencies are listed to be able to execute Gilt.

* `gilt.yml` file

  [Gilt](https://gilt.readthedocs.io) is a Git layering tool. We use Gilt to maintain the image versions,
  Ansible configuration and scripts within the `environments/manager` directory.

  The [current gilt.yml](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics/blob/main/gilt.yml) file is always
  located in the [osism/cfg-generics](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics) repository.

* `Makefile` file
