# Configuration Repository

The configuration required for OSISM is stored in a single Git monorepo, the configuration repository.

## Configuration repository layout

A configuration repository is always composed of the same basic layout.

* **`environments` directory**
* **`inventory` directory**
* **`netbox` directory (optional)**
* **`requirements.txt` file**

  In the `requirements.txt` the necessary dependencies are listed to be able to execute Gilt.

* **`gilt.yml` file**

  [Gilt](https://gilt.readthedocs.io) is a Git layering tool. We use Gilt to maintain the image versions,
  Ansible configuration and scripts within the `environments/manager` directory.

  The [current gilt.yml](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics/blob/main/gilt.yml) file is always
  located in the [osism/cfg-generics](https://github.com/osism/cfg-generics) repository.

  To use Gilt the dependencies are installed first. If Gilt is not installed via the `requirements.txt` it
  is important to use a version smaller v2. The v2 of Gilt is not yet usable.

  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  After that you can update the manager environment in `environments/manager`. Since the `gilt.yml`
  itself is updated with Gilt it is always important to run the command twice.

  ```
  gilt overlay
  gilt overlay
  ```

## Creating a new configuration repository

The initial content for this repository is generated using the
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter).

### Git repository

The content generated by the cookiecutter in the `output/configuration` directory is
committed to a new Git repository. By default, it is assumed that the configuration
repository is stored on GitHub. This can also be GitLab or an internal Git service
as well.

Host and path to the Git repository are specified via the `git_` parameters: The
`git_` parameters do not specify the path to the cookiecutter to use.

```
  [8/20] git_host (github.com):
  [9/20] git_port (22):
  [10/20] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY): regiocloud/configuration
  [11/20] git_username (git):
  [12/20] git_version (main):
```

In this case, the generated configuration in the `output/configuration` directory is
stored on GitHub in the `regiocloud/configuration` repository.

### Creation

In this example a new configuration repository is created with the defaults. The current stable
version of OSISM is used. The use of latest is described in the section
[Use of latest](#use-of-latest).

The directory `output` is created and used as output volume.

```
mkdir output
```

The cookiecutter is executed within a container. Docker must be usable on the system
on which the cookiecutter is to be used. It should also work with podman.

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/output -it quay.io/osism/cookiecutter
[1/20] with_ceph (1):
[2/20] ceph_network_backend (192.168.80.0/20):
[3/20] ceph_network_frontend (192.168.64.0/20):
[4/20] ceph_version (quincy):
[5/20] domain (osism.xyz):
[6/20] fqdn_external (api.osism.xyz):
[7/20] fqdn_internal (api-int.osism.xyz):
[8/20] git_host (github.com):
[9/20] git_port (22):
[10/20] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY):
[11/20] git_username (git):
[12/20] git_version (main):
[13/20] ip_external (192.168.96.9):
[14/20] ip_internal (192.168.32.9):
[15/20] manager_version (6.0.2):
[16/20] name_server (149.112.112.112):
[17/20] ntp_server (de.pool.ntp.org):
[18/20] openstack_version (2023.1):
[19/20] project_name (configuration):
[...]
```

Since we run the cookiecutter inside a container, the user rights are not correct
afterwards and have to be changed.

```
sudo chown -R $USER: output/
```

### Use of latest

When you want to use latest this is done via the parameter `manager_version`.
By default, this is always set to the current stable version.

```
manager_version [6.0.2]: latest
```

If the `manager_version` parameter is set to `latest` it is also possible to explicitly
set the `openstack_version` and the `ceph_version`.

### Make commit

The content is now committed to the previously created Git repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY.git YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cp -r output/configuration/* output/configuration/.gitignore YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cd YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ git add .gitignore *
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push
```

The `secrets` directory is not stored in the Git repository. Its contents can be
stored in a suitable location.

The `secrets` directory contains an SSH key pair which is used as a deploy key to
make the configuration repository available on the manager node later. Write access
is not required. The public SSH key is stored in the file `secrets/id_rsa.configuration.pub`.

How to add a deploy key on GitHub is documented in
[Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys).

### Post-processing

The configuration repository that is initially created with the Cookiecutter is not directly usable.
For example, the inventory needs to be built. All further information can be found in the
[Configuration Guide](./).

### Notes

* The password for Ansible Vault encrypted files, ist stored at `secrets/vaultpass`.
* The password of the generated Keepass file is `password`. This has to be changed.
