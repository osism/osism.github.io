# Ceph

In OSISM it is also possible to integrate and use existing Ceph clusters. It
is not necessary to deploy Ceph with OSISM. If Ceph is deployed with OSISM, it
should be noted that OSISM does not claim to provide all possible features of Ceph.
Ceph provided with OSISM is intended to provide the storage for Glance, Nova, Cinder
and Manila. In a specific way that has been implemented by OSISM for years. It
should be checked in advance whether the way in OSISM the Ceph deployment and the
provided features are sufficient. If this is not the case, it is recommended to
deploy Ceph in a different way directly and independently of OSISM. For possible
open source projects, please refer to
[cephadm](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephadm/index.html) and
[Rook](https://rook.io).

:::warning

Before starting the Ceph deployment, the configuration and creation of the necessary LVM2
volumes must be completed. The steps that are required for this can be found in the
[Ceph Configuration Guide](../../configuration-guide/ceph#lvm-devices).

:::

1. Deploy services.

   * Deploy [ceph-mon](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/man/8/ceph-mon/) services

     ```
     osism apply ceph-mons
     ```

   * Deploy ceph-mgr services

     ```
     osism apply ceph-mgrs
     ```

   * Deploy [ceph-osd](https://docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/man/8/ceph-osd/) services

     ```
     osism apply ceph-osds
     ```

   * Generate pools and keys. This step is only necessary for OSISM >= 7.0.0.

     ```
     osism apply ceph-pools
     ```

   * Deploy ceph-crash services

     ```
     osism apply ceph-crash
     ```

   :::info

   It's all done step by step here. It is also possible to do this in a single step.
   This speeds up the entire process and avoids unnecessary restarts of individual
   services.

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="osism-7" label="OSISM >= 7.0.0">
   ```
   osism apply ceph
   ```

   Generate pools and keys.

   ```
   osism apply ceph-pools
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="osism-6" label="OSISM < 7.0.0">
   ```
   osism apply ceph-base
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   :::

2. Get ceph keys. This places the necessary keys in `/opt/configuration`.

   ```
   osism apply copy-ceph-keys
   ```

   After run, these keys must be permanently added to the configuration repository
   via Git.

   ```
   environments/infrastructure/files/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/gnocchi/ceph.client.gnocchi.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ceph.client.cinder.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ceph.client.nova.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/cinder/cinder-backup/ceph.client.cinder.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/cinder/cinder-backup/ceph.client.cinder-backup.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/cinder/cinder-volume/ceph.client.cinder.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/manila/ceph.client.manila.keyring
   environments/kolla/files/overlays/glance/ceph.client.glance.keyring
   ```

   If the `osism apply copy-ceph-keys` fails because the keys are not found in the `/share`
   directory, this can be ignored. The keys of the predefined keys (e.g. for Manila) were
   then not created as they are not used. If you only use Ceph and do not need the predefined
   keys for OpenStack at all, you can also overwrite the `ceph_kolla_keys` parameter to skip
   these keys.

   ```yaml title="environments/ceph/configuration.yml"
   ceph_kolla_keys: []
   ```

3. After the Ceph keys have been persisted in the configuration repository, the Ceph
   client can be deployed.

   ```
   osism apply cephclient
   ```

4. Enable and prepare the use of the Ceph dashboard.

   ```
   osism apply ceph-bootstrap-dashboard
   ```

## RGW service

Deployment of the Ceph RGW Service is optional. How the Ceph RGW service can be deployed
and integrated into OpenStack is described here.

:::info

If an initial deployment is performed and Ceph RGW is not added to an existing deployment,
steps 4 and 5 are **not** required.

Step 3 is then performed **later after** the OpenStack Keystone service has been deployed.

:::

1. [Configure the RGW service](./../../configuration-guide/ceph#rgw-service)

2. Apply role `ceph-rgws` to deploy the Ceph RGW services.

   ```
   osism apply ceph-rgws
   ```

3. Apply role `kolla-ceph-rgw` to add the OpenStack endpoint.

   ```
   osism apply kolla-ceph-rgw
   ```

4. Apply role `loadbalancer` to add the HAProxy backend and frontend.

   ```
   osism apply loadbalancer
   ```

5. Apply role `horizon` to enable the Swift dashboard.

   ```
   osism apply horizon
   ```
