# Services

:::info

The prerequisite for depoying the services of a cluster is the bootstrap of
the nodes. How to bootstrap the nodes is documented in the
[Bootstrap chapter of the Deploy Guide](../bootstrap.md).

:::

When setting up a new cluster, the services are deployed in a specific order.

1. [Infrastructure](./infrastructure.md)
2. [Network](./network.md)
3. [Logging & Monitoring](./logging-monitoring.md)
4. [Ceph](./ceph.mdx)
5. [OpenStack](./openstack.md)
