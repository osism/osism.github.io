# Apply


Applies are there to roll out Ansible Plays.  These are executed as background activity via a queuing system so that, for example, the loss of an SSH connection does not result in the execution being aborted.
In this case, the logs can also be analyzed [retrospectively](./log).

It's also possible to have custom plays, this is [described in the operations guide]().

## Use of custom plays

Custom Plays can be used in all environments in the configuration repository.

For example, this is a play to prepare all devices to be used for Ceph on a Ceph
resource node. It is saved in the configuration repository in the file
`environments/ceph/playbook-wipe-partitions.yml`. It is run with
`osism apply -e ceph wipe-parititons`.

```yaml title="environments/ceph/playbook-wipe-partitions.yml
---
- name: Wipe partitions
  hosts: ceph-resource
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Wipe partitions
      become: true
      ansible.builtin.shell: |
        wipefs --all "{{ item }}"
        dd if=/dev/zero of="{{ item }}" bs=1 count=4096
      changed_when: false
      with_items: "{{ devices }}"
```
