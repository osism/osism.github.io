In blog posts with the tag Sneak Peak, we will now write about new features before the next major release. This blog entry is specifically about the possibility of deploying services on the recently integrated Kubernetes cluster. The deployment of services on the integrated Kubernetes cluster will be possible in future via the kubernetes environment. A first simple example for the deployment of Nginx is already available in the osism/testbed repository. The new environment is used as usual with osism apply. $ osism apply -e kubernetes nginx $ kubectl get pods -n nginx NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-f7f5c78c5-crhnf 1/1 Running 0 2m28s nginx-f7f5c78c5-tjf6r 1/1 Running 0 2m28s nginx-f7f5c78c5-qbqjz 1/1 Running 0 2m28 $ kubectl get services -n nginx NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx LoadBalancer 10.43.84.203 192.168.16.100 80:30612/TCP 2m46s $ curl -I http://192.168.16.100 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx/1.25.3","s":"Kubernetes Service Deployments","u":"/de/blog/2024-01-11-kubernetes-service-deployment","h":"","p":1073},{"i":1076,"t":"We not only develop OSISM, we also use it to operate our own cloud infrastructure, the REGIO.cloud. When operating REGIO.cloud, we often come across tasks in our day-to-day business that we can already solve with the help of OSISM. If not, we open an issue for the task and build it in so that we can solve it directly in OSISM in the future. In blog posts with the tag Machine Room, we will now write about such tasks and how we were able to solve them with OSISM. Yesterday we had a hiccup in our RabbitMQ cluster. This has caused problems with the attachment of volumes to instances during the night. After analyzing the problem, it was decided that only a restart of the nova_compute containers, which provide the Nova Compute Service, would solve the problem. With the play manage-container it is possible to run an action, e.g. restart, of a specific container. As we have our compute nodes in housings, we have also mapped them in the inventory in inventory/10-custom and can now use those groups to restart all Nova Compute services one by one. $ osism apply manage-container \\ -e container_action=restart \\ -e container_name=nova_compute \\ -l housing1047 2024-01-12 08:28:55 | INFO | Task was prepared for execution.

With OSISM, it is possible to manage any number of independent loadbalancers via a single OSISM manager service using sub-environments. A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory below the environments directory of the configuration repository with a special name. A sub-environment for an additional loadbalancer always has the name kolla.NAME as the loadbalancer is provided as part of Kolla. The kolla.NAME directory in the configuration repository then contains the configuration.yml, images.yml and secrets.yml files as usual. The following directories and files are also required in a sub-environment for a loadbalancer. File Description certificates/ca/custom.crt The file is optional. If a custom CA is used, it must be added here. certificates/haproxy-internal.pem SSL certificate to be used. files/overlays/haproxy/services.d/haproxy.cfg HAProxy configuration to be used on the loadbalancer. In this example, a sub-environment kolla.external is created, which is used for an outward facing loadbalancer that only offers certain API services. In comparison to the normal kolla environment, the groups to be used must be overwritten for a Kolla sub-environment. In this case, one group is defined: kolla.external.loadbalancer. It is recommended to base the name of the groups on the name of the sub-environments. The group kolla.external.loadbalancer is added to the global inventory in the 10-custom file. In this example, testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz is used for the second loadbalancer. inventory/10-custom [kolla.external.loadbalancer] testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz It is also important to ensure that the nodes used for the second loadbalancer are not included in the loadbalancer group. This can be checked with osism get hosts -l loadbalancer. If the nodes of the second loadbalancer are also listed there, the loadbalancer group in the 99-overwrite file of the global inventory must be overwritten. In this example, the loadbalaner group is overwritten so that only testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz and testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz are left in the loadbalancer group. inventory/99-overwrite [loadbalancer] testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz Furthermore, in a Kolla sub-environment that is only used for a loadbalancer, only a few additional parameters are required in the configuration.yml file. Don't get confused, only the kolla_*internal* parameters and the haproxy-internal.pem file are used here in the example. This is because we only want to configure one virtual IP address on the external loadbalancer and the loadbalancer managed by Kolla has the internal IP address by default. It is therefore not possible with Kolla to use only the kolla_*external* parameters as an additional virtual IP address with default values would then be configured by default. environments/kolla.external/configuration.yml --- ########################################################## # hosts hosts_kolla_all: kolla.external.loadbalancer hosts_kolla_loadbalancer: kolla.external.loadbalancer ########################################################## # docker docker_namespace: osism ########################################################## # loadbalancer kolla_internal_vip_address: 192.168.24.200 kolla_internal_fqdn: api.testbed.osism.com kolla_enable_tls_internal: \"yes\" # Required if a custom CA is used. kolla_copy_ca_into_containers: \"yes\" At the moment it is only possible to deploy the loadbalancer itself with its own configuration.

OSISM will generally look for files in environments/kolla/files/overlays/CONFIGFILE, environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/CONFIGFILE or environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/HOSTNAME/CONFIGFILE in the configuration repository. These locations sometimes vary and you should check the config task in the appropriate Ansible role for a full list of supported locations. For example, in the case of nova.conf the following locations are supported, assuming that you have services using nova.conf running on hosts called ctl1, ctl2 and ctl3: environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl1/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl2/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl3/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf Using this mechanism, overrides can be configured per-project (Nova), per-project-service (Nova scheduler service) or per-project-service-on-specified-host (Nova servies on ctl1). Overriding an option is as simple as setting the option under the relevant section. For example, to set override scheduler_max_attempts in the Nova scheduler service, the operator could create environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [DEFAULT] scheduler_max_attempts = 100 If the operator wants to configure the initial disk, cpu and ram allocation ratio on compute node com1, the operator needs to create the file environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/com1/nova.conf with this content: [DEFAULT] initial_cpu_allocation_ratio = 3.0 initial_ram_allocation_ratio = 1.0 initial_disk_allocation_ratio = 1.0 Note that the numbers shown here with an initial_cpu_allocation_ratio of 3.0 do match the requirements of the SCS-nV-* (moderate oversubscription) flavors. If you do not use SMT/hyperthreading, SCS would allow 5.0 here (for the V flavors). This method of merging configuration sections is supported for all services using oslo.config, which includes the vast majority of OpenStack services, and in some cases for services using YAML configuration. Since the INI format is an informal standard, not all INI files can be merged in this way. In these cases OSISM supports overriding the entire config file. Additional flexibility can be introduced by using Jinja conditionals in the config files. For example, you may create Nova cells which are homogeneous with respect to the hypervisor model. In each cell, you may wish to configure the hypervisors differently, for example the following override shows one way of setting the bandwidth_poll_interval variable as a function of the cell: [DEFAULT] {% if 'cell0001' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 100 {% elif 'cell0002' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = -1 {% else %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 300 {% endif %} An alternative to Jinja conditionals would be to define a variable for the bandwidth_poll_interval and set it in according to your requirements in the inventory group or host vars: [DEFAULT] bandwidth_poll_interval = {{ bandwidth_poll_interval }} OSISM allows the operator to override configuration globally for all services. It will look for a file called environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository. For example to modify database pool size connection for all services, the operator needs to create environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [database] max_pool_size = 100","s":"Customization of the service configurations","u":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/","h":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/#customization-of-the-service-configurations","p":1318},{"i":1331,"t":"It is explained with example of OpenSearch Service how the configuration for OpenSearch is created and gets into the container.

That said, the setup is not depending on anything specific from openSUSE and should work on every modern Linux distribution. Setting it up again in a different environment using Debian 12 images avoids a few of the shortcuts that were used and thus should be very suitable instructions to get it working in general. The step by step instructions are covered here. Note: This is a rather classical snowflake setup -- we create a VM and do some manual configuration to get everything configured. Having it well documented here should make this more replicatable, and is an important precondition for more automation, but larger steps to full automate this using ansible or helm charts (in a containerized variant) are not addressed here. As we expect a successor project for the increasingly hard to maintain shell code, this may not be worth the trouble. openstack-health-monitor implements a scripted scenario test with a large shell-script that uses the openstackclient tools to set up the scenario, test it and tear everything down again in a loop. Any errors are recorded, as well as timings and some very basic benchmarks. The script sets up some virtual network infrastructure (routers, networks, subnets, floating IPs), security groups, keypairs, volumes and finally boots some VMs. Access to these is tested (ensuring metadata injection works) and connectivity between them tested and measured. A loadbalancer (optionally) is set up with a health-monitor and access via it before and after killing some backends is tested. The scenario is described in a bit more detail in the repository's README.md file. The openstack-health-monitor is not the intended long-term solution for monitoring your infrastructure. The SCS project has a project underway that will create more modern, flexible, and more maintainable monitoring infrastructure; the concepts are described on the monitoring section of the project's documentation. The openstack-health-monitor will thus not see any significant enhancements any more; it will be maintained and kept alive as long as there are users. This guide exclusively focuses on how to set it up.","s":"Intro","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#intro","p":1726},{"i":1731,"t":"So we start a Debian 12 image on a cloud of our choice.

Having the tests happily continuing to collect data may actually be valuable in times when external access is barred. If the cloud goes down, we will no longer see API calls against it, although the information of them not being available does not reveal much in terms of insight into the reasons for the outage. Also, the driver VM is the only long-lived VM in the openstack-health-monitor setup, so it may be useful to have it in the same cloud to reveal any issues that do not occur on the short-lived resources created and deleted by the health-monitor. The author tends to see running it internally as advantageous -- ideally combined with a simple API reachability test from the outside that sends alarms as needed to detect any reachability problems.","s":"Internal vs external monitoring","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#internal-vs-external-monitoring","p":1726},{"i":1735,"t":"Nothing in this test requires admin privileges on the cloud where the driver runs nor on the cloud under test.

The openstack-health-monitor is carefully designed to not clean up anything that it has not created. There is however some trickiness, as not all resources have names (floating IPs for example do not) and sometimes names need to be assigned after creation of a resource (volumes of diskless flavors), so in case there are API errors, some heuristics is used to identify resources which may not be safe under all circumstances.

The script api_monitor.sh is the main worker of openstack-health-monitor and runs one to many iterations of a cycle where resources are created, tested and torn down. Its operation is described in the README.md file. It is good practice to use tmux. This allows you to return (reattach) to console sessions and to open new windows to investigate things. Traditional people may prefer to screen over tmux. You should be ready to run one iteration of the openstack-health-monitor now. Run it like this: export IMG=\"Debian 12\" export JHIMG=\"Debian 12\" ./api_monitor.sh -O -C -D -n 6 -s -b -B -M -T -LL -i 1 Leave out the -LL if you don't have a working loadbalancer service or replace -LL with -LO if you want to test the ovn loadbalancer instead of amphorae (saving quite some resources). Feel free to study the meaning of all the command line parameters by looking at the README.md. (Note: Many of the things enabled by the parameters should be default, but are not for historic reasons. This would change if we rewrite this whole thing in python.) This will run for ~7 minutes, depending on the performance of your OpenStack environment. You should not get any error. (The amber-colored outputs DOWN, BUILD, creating are not errors. Nothing in red should be displayed.) Studying the console output may be instructive to follow the script's progress. You may also open another window (remember the tmux recommendation above) and look at the resources with the usual openstack RESOURCE list and openstack RESOURCE show NAME and RESOURCE being something like router, network, subnet, port, volume, server, floating ip, loadbalancer, loadbalancer pool, loadbalancer listener, security group, keypair, image, ...) The api_monitor.sh uses and APIMonitor_TIMESTAMP prefix for all OpenStack resource names. This allows to identify the created resources and clean them up even if things go wrong. TIMESTAMP is an integer number representing the seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (Unix time). This may be the time to check that you have sufficient quota to create the resources. While we only create 6+N VMs (and volumes) with the above call (N being the number of AZs), we would want to increase this number for larger clouds. For single-AZ deployments, we would want to still use 2 networks at least -N 2 to test the ability of the router to route traffic between networks. So expect -n 6 to become -N 2 -n 6 for a very small single-AZ cloud or -n 12 for a large 3 AZ cloud region.

You can change the flavors. If you have to pay for this, also consider that some clouds are not charging by the minute but may count by the started hour. So when you run api_monitor.sh in a loop (which you will) with say 10 VMs (e.g. -N 2 -n 8) in each iteration and run this for an hour with 8 iterations, you will never have more than 10 VMs in parallel and they only are alive a bit more than half of the time, but rather than being charged for ~6 VM hours, you end up being charged for ~80 VM hours. Similar for volumes, routers, floating IPs. This makes a huge difference. Sometimes the cloud under test has issues. That's why we do monitoring ... One thing that might happen is that loadbalancers and volumes (and other resources, but those two are the most prone to this) end up in a broken state that can not be cleaned up by the user any more. Bad providers may charge for these anyhow, although this will never stand a legal dispute. (IANAL, but charging for providing something that is not working is not typically supported by civil law in most jurisdictions and T&Cs that would say so would not normally be legally enforceable.) If this happens, I recommend to keep records of the broken state (store the output of openstack volume list, openstack volume show BROKEN_VOLUME, openstack loadbalancer list, openstack loadbalancer show BROKEN_LB.)

In the dashboard, go to the settings gear wheel, variables, mycloud and add CLOUDNAME to the list of clouds that can be displayed. (There are some existing SCS clouds in that list.) Save.

No data displayed?​ Sometimes, you may see a panel displaying \"no data\" despite the fact that the first full iteration of data has been sent to influx already. This may be a strange interaction between the browser and Grafana -- we have not analyzed whether that is a bug in Grafana. One way to work around is to go into the setting of the panel (the three dots in the upper right corner), go to edit and start changing one aspect of the query. Apply. Change it back to the original. Apply. The data will appear. Save to be sure it's conserved. Dashboard features​ Look at the top line filters: You can filter to only see certain API calls or certain resources; the graphs are very crowded and filtering to better see what you want to focus on is very well intended. The first row of panels give a health impression; there are absolute numbers as well as percentage numbers and the panels turn amber and red in case you have too many errors. Note that the colors on the panels with absolute numbers can not take into account whether you look at just a few hours or at weeks. Accordingly, consider the colors a reasonable hint if things are green or not when looking at a ~24 hours interval. This limitation does not affect the colors on the percentage graph, obviously. You can change the time interval and zoom in also by marking an interval with the mouse. Zooming out to a few months can be a very useful feature to see trends and watch e.g. your API performance, your resource creation times or the benchmarks change over the long term. github OIDC integration​ The SCS providers do allow all github users that belong to the SovereignCloudStack organization to get Viewer access to the dashboards by adding a client_id and client_secret in the [github.auth] section that you request from the SCS github admins (github's oauth auth). This allows to exchange experience and to get a feeling for the achievable stability.

Sometimes the VMs end up being ACTIVE as wanted but then they can't be accessed via ssh. More often than not, this is a problem with meta-data service on a compute host. Without metadata, not ssh key is injected and login will fail. To gather more details, you can look at the console output openstack console log show VM (where VM is the name of the uuid of the affected VM instance). The cloud-init output is often enough to see what has gone wrong. You can log in to the VMs: The jumphosts are directly accessible via ssh -i APIMonitor_XXXXX_JH.pem debian@FIP, whereas the JumpHost does port forwarding to the other VMs that don't have their own floating IP address: ssh -i APIMonitor_XXXXX_VM.pem -p 222 debian@FIP. Replace XXXXX with the number in your current APIMonitor prefix, FIP with the floating IP address of the responsible JumpHost and debian with the user name used by the images you boot. Use 223 to connect to the second VM in the network, 224 the third etc. When logged in, look at /var/log/cloud-init-output.log and /var/log/cloud-init.log. You can find the metadata in /var/lib/cloud/instance/. You will not have much time to look around -- the still running api_monitor.sh script does continue and clean things up again. So you might want to suspend it with ^Z (and continue it later with fg). Another option is to not stop the regular monitoring, but start a second instance manually; see above notes for running multiple instances though. If you start a second instance manually against the same project, do NOT use the run_CLOUDNAME.sh script as it would do cleanup against the running instance, but rather copy the api_monitor.sh command line from the bottom (without the exec), reduce the iterations to a few (unless you need a lot to trigger the issue again) and attach -w -1 to make the script stop its operation (and wait for Enter) once it hits an error. Of course, you still will face cleanup when the continuing main script hits its 200th iteration and you have chosen to run this second instance against the same project in the same cloud. After analyzing, do not forget to go back to the tmux window where the stopped script is running and do hit Enter, so it can continue and do its cleanup work.","s":"Analyzing failures","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#analyzing-failures","p":1726},{"i":1783,"t":"If you are unlucky, the script fails to clean something up. A volume may not have been named (because of a cinder failure) or all the logic may have gone wrong, e.g. the heuristic to avoid leaking floating IPs. You can try to clean this up using the normal openstack commands (or horizon dashboard). There are a few things that may need support from a cloud admin: Volumes may end up permanently in a deleting or reserved state or may be in-use, attached to a VM that has long gone. The admin needs to set the state to error and then delete them. Loadbalancers may end up in a PENDING_XXX state (XXX being CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE) without ever changing. This also needs the cloud admin to set the status to ERROR, so it can be cleaned up. amphorae are more prone to this than ovn LBs. More like these may happen, but those two are the only ones that have been observed to happen occasionally. Some services seem to be less robust than others against an event in the event queue (rabbitmq) being lost or an connection to be interrupted.

In file terraform/clouds.yaml.sample you will find examples of typical setups. Settings that are identical for all users of a cloud can be defined centrally via the profiles of the file terraform/clouds-public.yaml. You can reference these settings by using the profile parameter in cloud-specific definition in terraform/clouds.yaml. The user specific settings of the clouds.yaml file are provided by the cloud provider. Please check the documentation of the cloud provider you are using or their support for details. REGIO.cloud is used as an example here. The cloud name in clouds.yaml and the environment name (value of ENVIRONMENT) are regiocloud in this case. It is important that the name of the cloud in clouds.yaml matches the name of the environment to be used. The names must be identical. It is currently not possible to name the cloud regiocloud-123 in clouds.yaml if the environment is regiocloud. If another cloud is used, replace regiocloud with the respective profile name from the table above. Application Credentials Username/Password The use of application credentials is preferred. This way it is not necessary to store details like username, project name or sensitive information like the password in the clouds.yaml file. The application credentials can be found in Horizon under Identity.

The versions of Ansible and OpenTofu are managed automatically and necessary dependencies are cloned. make prepare If any error occurs during preparation and you want to run the preparation again, it is important to run make wipe-local-install first. Otherwise the preparation will not be redone completely and necessary parts will be missing later on. Create the infrastructure with OpenTofu. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud create Deploy the OSISM manager and bootstrap all nodes. Deploy latest manager version Deploy a stable manager version make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud manager make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud VERSION_MANAGER=7.0.3 manager After the bootstrap, you can log in to the manager via SSH. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login Yo can log in to the nodes of the cluster via the manager. osism console testbed-node-0 Deploy all services. Deployment in single steps Deployment of all services It is also possible to deploy the services step by step on the manager. To do this, first log in to the manager with make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login and then execute the deploy scripts one after the other. It is recommended to do this within a screen session. Deploying the services takes some time and depends on how much bandwidth is available, how the instances are equipped, etc. 90-120 minutes is not unusual when Ceph and OpenStack are fully deployed. To speed up the Ansible playbooks, ARA can be disabled. This is done by executing /opt/configuration/scripts/disable-ara.sh. Run this script before the deployment scripts. Afterwards no more logs are available in the ARA web interface. To re-enable ARA use /opt/configuration/scripts/enable-ara.sh. There is also the option of pre-population of images with /opt/configuration/scripts/pull-images.sh so that deployments do not have to be lengthy. Run this script before the deployment scripts. /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/001-helper-services.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/005-kubernetes.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-ceph-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/200-infrastructure-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/300-openstack-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring-services.sh Prepare OpenStack resources like public network, flavors and images by running /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap.sh.

The 5: prefix is placed in front of the version. Commit and push the changes to your configuration repository afterwards. The upgrade of Docker is then done with the OSISM CLI. Docker on the manager itself is updated differently. This does not work on the manager itself because the Docker service may be started during the upgrade and individual containers may be started as a result. This would interrupt the run of the role itself. osism apply docker -l 'docker:!manager' By default, serial is set to 1 so that the the hosts are upgrade one after the other. To adjust this, either use the osism_serial dictionary in the environments/configuration.yml file to change the value in docker or append -e serial=10% to upgrade, for example, 10% with each iteration. Please note that it is not a good idea to upgrade more than one Docker service at a time. This can lead to anomalies, especially on storage nodes and control nodes. It is recommended not to change the default of 1. osism_serial: docker: 10% On the manager itself, the run.sh script in the manager environment of the configuration must currently be used to upgrade the Docker service. In a future release a dedicated osism update docker command will be available for this purpose. cd /opt/configuration/environments/manager ANSIBLE_ASK_VAULT_PASS=True ./run.sh docker","s":"Docker","u":"/de/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/docker","h":"","p":2001},{"i":2004,"t":"When upgrading, the Docker service is restarted. As a result, it can come to a restart of the running containers. This can lead to interruptions in individual services. A change in /etc/docker/daemon.json due to a new configuration parameter etc. can also result in a required restart. Whether the containers are restarted when the Docker Service is restarted depends on whether the Live Restore feature is used. This can be configured via the parameter docker_live_restore. Live restore is enabled by default. It is important to set the docker_live_restore parameter explicitly as a string. This means docker_live_restore: \"false\" or docker_live_restore: \"true\". But even if the Live Restore feature is enabled, certain upgrades will cause running containers to be restarted: Live restore allows you to keep containers running across Docker daemon updates, but is only supported when installing patch releases (YY.MM.x), not for major (YY.MM) daemon upgrades. There are two ways to prevent a restart of the Docker service during an upgrade. If the restart behaviour of the Docker service is changed, always make sure to restart the Docker service manually afterwards (e.g. by a system reboot). A host group can be defined via the parameter docker_ignore_restart_groupname. The restart of the Docker service is not triggered for all hosts in this group. By default, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to manager. The parameter is best set in the environments/configuration.yml file when making an adjustment. For example, to prevent the restart on all hosts, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to generic. docker_ignore_restart_groupname: generic With the parameter docker_allow_restart, the restart of the Docker service can be prevented. By default, docker_allow_restart is set to true. It is recommended to set this parameter only at runtime.

Read the release notes even if you are only updating from e.g. 7.0.2 to 7.0.5. The update of a manager service with a stable release of OSISM is described here. In the example, OSISM release 7.0.5 is used. Change the OSISM release in the configuration repository. 1.1. Set the new OSISM version in the configuration repository. MANAGER_VERSION=7.0.5 sed -i -e \"s/manager_version: .*/manager_version: ${MANAGER_VERSION}/g\" environments/manager/configuration.yml 1.2. If openstack_version or ceph_version are set in environments/manager/configuration.yml (or anywhere else), they must be removed. If these are set, the stable release is not used for these components. 1.3. Sync the image versions and files in the configuration repository.

To do this, first check which version of osism/cfg-generics is used in a particular release. The version is defined in generics_version in the base.yml file in the osism/release repository. For OSISM 6.0.0, for example, this is version v0.20230919.0. This version is then added to the file gilt.yml in the configuration repository instead of main at version. This change must be made again after each execution of gilt overlay as it is overwritten by the call of gilt overlay. This cannot be realized differently in the current implementation of Gilt. 1.4.

Usually security groups are assigned to the Port(s) when a virtual machine is created, but assignments can also be changed at runtime later on. Multiple security groups can be assigned to a VM or Port simultaneously and in such case they will be combined as the union of all their rules. caution Security groups are mutable resources.

Use this information to identify all incoming and outgoing traffic rules that will be needed based on the communication patterns of the services it is meant to deploy. This includes communication protocols, port numbers, communication directions and optionally target/source address ranges. Look through already existing security groups and their rules. If a security group allows more traffic than needed it SHOULD NOT be used. If a security group contains only a subset of the required rules it MAY be used in combination with other security groups that contain rules which fulfill the remaining required traffic rules from point 1. If you were not successful in finding an appropriate combination of existing security groups or you need additional specific rules to cover all requirements, you MAY create one or more new Security Groups in which you can add the required rules.

But that only should be done while also restricting the SSH configuration to public key authentication only (the recommended way) or having a strong username and password policy already applied to the operating system of the virtual machine. Otherwise default usernames and passwords which are often preconfigured in system images may be exploited through the exposed SSH port which enables attackers to compromise the virtual machine. ICMP It might be useful to be able to ping a virtual machine or use other ICMP requests. But for some virtual machine configurations this is either not necessary at all or only temporarily needed.

If the source volume of the backup still exists, the original volume type can be determined by inspecting the backup's volume_id attribute and then using it to look up the corresponding volume and its type attribute. The following client command can be used for this (fill in the value for BACKUP_ID): export BACKUP_ID=...

No upgrade of Ceph is required. The OpenStack service images have not been rebuilt. No upgrade of OpenStack is required. Bugfixes in the osism.commons.network role. When extending the role for CentOS and RHEL, a bug was introduced that prevented existing Netplan files from being deleted on Ubuntu. This has been fixed. Bugfixes in the osism.services.netdata role. The repositories used were changed from Packagecloud to the repositories offered by the Netdata project itself. In this way, unresolvable package dependencies on Ubuntu 22.04 are now resolved. New features in the osism.services.manager role. The use of the Netbox as the primary inventory is now optional, even with existing Netbox integration. It is therefore important to set the parameter manager_inventory_from_netbox to true before updating the manager service if the Netbox was previously used as the primary inventory. By default, the Netbox is not longer used as the primary inventory. manager_inventory_from_netbox: true New features in the osism.services.docker role. With the docker_throttle_restart parameter it's possible to throttle the service restarts. By default service restarts will not be throttled. docker_throttle_restart: 1 With the docker_wait_after_restart it is possible to wait docker_wait_after_restart_seconds seconds (60 seconds by default) after the restart of the Docker service. By default it will not be waited after the restart of the Docker service. docker_wait_after_restart: true docker_wait_after_restart_seconds: 60 New features in the osism.services.traefik role. With the traefik_configuration_extra parameter it's possible to add extra configuration to the Traefik service. With the traefik_extra_ports parameter it's possible to manage additional ports with traefik. E.g. to manage port 5000 and port 8774: traefik_extra_ports: - 5000 - 8774 With the traefik_configuration_dynamic parameter it's possible to define additional services via the file provider. This will add a router that routes all requests on api-81-163-192-117.traefik.me to the service-horizon service. traefik_configuration_dyanmic: tcp: services: service-horizon: loadBalancer: servers: - address: \"192.168.16.254:443\" routers: router-horizon: rule: \"HostSNI(`api-81-163-192-117.traefik.me`)\" service: service-horizon entryPoints: - https tls: passthrough: true New features in the osism.commons.operator role. With the operator_authorized_keys_delete parameter it's possible to delete authorized keys from the authorized key files of the operator user account. This is the counterpart to the operator_authorized_keys parameter. With the operator_authorized_github_accounts_delete parameter it's possible to delete all authorized keys from a list of GitHub accounts from the authorized key files of the operator user account. This is the counterpart to the operator_authorized_github_accounts parameter. New features in the osism.commons.known_hosts role. With the known_hosts_delete parameter it's possible to delete known hosts entries from the known hosts file of the operator user account. This is the counterpart to the known_hosts and known_hosts_extra parameters. New features in the osism.commons.user role. With the user_sudoers parameter it's possible to change the content of the user sudoers file. The default is ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL. New features in the osism.commons.proxy role. Proxy settings are now removed when no proxy setings are set with the proxy_proxies parameter. New playbooks and changes in the existing playbooks. The ensure-no-instances ensures that no instances are defined in Libvirt and that no qemu processes are running. This can be used in preparation for maintenance work on compute nodes. In the future, the play will also take care of moving running or assigned instances from a compute node with the help of the OSISM Resource Manager. With the loadbalancer-without-service-config play it's possible to manage the loadbalancer service without including all the OpenStack service roles. This makes it possible to do a loadbalancer container image upgrade pretty fast and also enables the deployment of multiple loadbalancers with separate configurations by using the sub environments. The osism.commons.sshconfig role and the osism.commons.certificates role are now also run in the bootstrap play of the Manager. With the k3s-upgrade play it is possible to upgrade the internal K3s Kubernetes cluster. New documentation. The documentation for the initial creation of a configuration repository using Cookiecutter has been completely revised. In the Cookiecutter itself, notes have been added in many places to simplify the initial reworking of the created configuration repository. Documentation for the deployment of a second loadbalancer has been added. Changes in the Testbed. It is now possible to provide the OpenStack APIs and the OpenStack Dashboard via a public IP address with a public DNS record including Letsencrypt certificate via a customisation external-api via the manager node. Ansible, which is required to initially deploy the Manager, is now installed in a virtual environment. This means that it is now also possible to use Ubuntu 24.04 as the operating system for the nodes. The CLI of the Simple Stress tool has been changed to Typer. Units tests for improving code quality have been added. New Kubernetes CAPI images for the Kubernetes serias 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30 are available. To avoid confusion, rolling-upgrade has been removed as a supported action for the osism apply command. The upgrade action should always and exclusively be used.","s":"7.0.5 (20240524)","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#705-20240524","p":2121},{"i":2126,"t":"Release date: 7.

The correct images for Nova and Octavia are now included in 7.0.4 and the bugs listed below have been fixed. An update of the Manager Service must be done and then, if required, an update of Nova and Octavia can be updated as originally planned for OSISM 7.0.3. We apologise for the mistake and the resulting effort. The OpenStack service images for Octavia and Nova have been rebuilt. Upgrades of the Octavia and Nova services are recommended. No upgrades of other OpenStack and associated infrastructure services such as MariaDB or RabbitMQ are required. The Nova images have been rebuilt to add packages to be able to use vTMP (osism/issues#1008) If this is not relevant, the upgrade can be skipped. The octavia images have been rebuilt to resolve an issue when creating a LB + a listener with an allowed_cidr with the fully-populated API (osism/issues#980) When upgrading the Nova and Octavia API services, there is a short downtime of the APIs.

This is due to a bug in the service units of all Kolla services. The bug is fixed in the current release. To avoid the delay during an upgrade, a fix must be applied in advance for all service units from Kolla. osism apply fix-gh973 The Kubernetes Cluster API image for the Kubernetes (K8s) 1.30 series is available. The images are now provided directly with osism manage image clusterapi. This means that K8s Cluster API images are now available for K8s series 1.27, 1.28, 1.29 and 1.30. All Ansible collections have been prepared for use with Ubuntu 24.04. It is currently not recommended to upgrade existing clusters to Ubuntu 24.04 or to install new clusters with Ubuntu 24.04. There will be a note in future release notes that announces the full support of Ubuntu 24.04. At the moment everything related to Ubuntu 24.04 is a technical preview. A new role tempest has been added to the Ansible collection osism.validations. This makes it possible to perform significantly more tests than with the previously used osism.validations.refstack role. The new role will be used in the testbed in future to significantly increase the number of tests performed in the CI. New documentation for the project manager and the simple stress. When using the reboot play, it is now possible to wait for the reboot to be completed (osism/issues#758). osism apply reboot \\ -e reboot_wait=yes \\ -e ireallymeanit=yes Monitoring services are now activated by default for the internal Kubernetes cluster.

The previous default was \"{{ node_custom_config }}\". If this is not wanted, the parameter must be overwritten in environments/kolla/configuration.yml. This is in preparation for the Ironic IPA images no longer being stored in the configuration repository but within the manager service at runtime. The Ironic IPA images are now downloaded from ironic play by default. If this is not wanted, enable_ironic_agent_download_images: false must be set in environments/kolla/configuration.yml. The Ironic IPA images can now also be downloaded independently of the ironic play with osism apply ironic-download-ipa-images. The ceph_cluster_fsid parameter is now generated automatically. It can be removed from environments/configuration.yml. The automatically generated ceph_clusterfs_fsid parameter is set to the value of the fsid parameter from environments/ceph/configuration.yml. You can now use your own hook scripts in osism/cfg-cookiecutter. These are placed in the directory {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/scripts.d/ directory. The scripts are executed in alphabetical order. The scripts must be executable. Versions not yet pinned in the manager environment of the configuration repository (Ansible collections, osism/cfg-generics, ..) are now automatically pinned during synchronisation with gilt overlay. This also applies to the osism update manager script. The Docker version and the Docker CLI version can now also be managed via osism/cfg-generics. It is recommended to pin the Docker version in environments/configuration.yml. docker_version: '5:24.0.9' When using the single service plays for Ceph (ceph-osds, ceph-mons, ..), no service restarts are executed for other services.

By default, only one Ceph service is restarted at a time. This can be adjusted with the ceph_handler_*_restart_throttle parameters.

The parameter enable_proxysql is added to environments/kolla/configuration.yml for this purpose. environments/kolla/configuration.yml enable_proxysql: yes The secrets listed below (proxysql_admin_password, proxysql_stats_password, mariadb_monitor_password) must also be added or changed. When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to upgrade MariaDB first. When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to perform the loadbalancer upgrade before all OpenStack service upgrades. To make sure that the OpenStack services continue to work after the upgrade when ProxySQL is enabled as part of the upgrade, the ProxySQL service must have been deployed first. The ProxySQL service is deployed with the loadbalancer play. It is possible that connectivity with the database may be interrupted for a short time during the migration. It is therefore recommended to carry out extensive tests on the staging environment in advance. The following secrets must be added in environments/kolla/secrets.yml: environments/kolla/secrets.yml octavia_persistence_database_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 prometheus_bcrypt_salt: # generate with: pwgen 22 1 <-- there's a 22 prometheus_grafana_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 prometheus_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 proxysql_admin_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 proxysql_stats_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 The parameter mariadb_monitoring_password in environments/kolla/secrets.yml has to be renamed to mariadb_monitor_password. If the parameter is not present, it is added. environments/kolla/secrets.yml mariadb_monitor_password: # generate with: pwgen 32 1 The following parameters must be removed from the configuration repository from environments/kolla/configuration.yml: environments/kolla/configuration.yml ceph_nova_user: nova ceph_nova_keyring: ceph.client.nova.keyring Parameters for the Netbox service in environments/infrastructure/configuration.yml or secrets.yml must now also be added in environments/manager/configuration.yml or secrets.yml. In an upcoming release, the parameters can be removed from the infrastructure environment. The Ansible callback plugin osism.commons.still_alive is now available to avoid timeouts for long-running tasks. This currently has to be explicitly enabled in the Ansible configuration. This is done in the environments/ansible.cfg file in the configuration repository. The callback plugin is enabled by default in the future. After this change has been made, the update of the manager must be performed. A manager with a version before OSISM 7.0.0 cannot be longer used if this plugin is set in environments/ansible.cfg. environments/ansible.cfg [defaults] ... stdout_callback = osism.commons.still_alive In the inventory, the nova_backend parameter must be added to the host vars of compute nodes where local storage is used. nova_backend: default The SSL certificate file haproxy.pem is now available in a different location in the haproxy container. Previously it was stored under /etc/haproxy/haproxy.pem. From now on it is stored under /etc/haproxy/certificates/haproxy.pem. If you have customised the configuration for the haproxy service or use overlays for this, adjust the locations of the SSL certificate as required. Due to the upgrade from Fluentd to version 5, some directory names within the container image for Fluentd have changed. If you have worked with overlay files in the Fluentd service, check these in advance. Currently we know that /var/run/td-agent is now available as /var/run/fluentd (check osism/issues#864 for details). We assume that other directory names have changed similarly. If a Keystone domain with LDAP backend is used, it is important to add the tls_cacertfile parameter in the [ldap] section of the corresponding domain configuration. [ldap] ... tls_cacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt The management of Ceph pools and Ceph clients/keys has been moved to a separate play ceph-pools. It is important to set the openstack_config parameter in environments/ceph/configuration.yml to false or remove it completely if it still exists or is not yet set to false.","s":"Upgrade notes","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#upgrade-notes","p":2121},{"i":2142,"t":"If error Couldn't fetch the key client.bootstrap-rbd at /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-rbd/.\" occurs when updating Ceph in task create potentially missing keys (rbd and rbd-mirror), create directory /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-rbd/ on the 1st control node used for Ceph.

A bugfix for this will be made available soon. There is another problem when using Octavia in combination with OVN which leads to a leakage of ports when deleting load balancers (osism/issues#921). A bugfix for this is also expected to be available soon. The manager service is updated via osism update manager. If this command is not yet available, you can use osism-update-manager as an alternative. osism: 'update manager' is not an osism command. See 'osism --help'. With some upgrades we noticed that in certain constellations there were problems with the OpenStack Octavia service, which could be prevented if the parameter valid_interfaces was added to the environments/kolla/files/overlays/octavia.conf file (osism/issues#1021). environments/kolla/files/overlays/octavia.conf [certificates] valid_interfaces = internal [keystone_authtoken] valid_interfaces = internal [glance] valid_interfaces = internal [neutron] valid_interfaces = internal [nova] valid_interfaces = internal","s":"Known issues","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#known-issues","p":2121},{"i":2144,"t":"Refstack 2022.11 results: ====== Totals ====== Ran: 356 tests in 1221.9879 sec. - Passed: 353 - Skipped: 3 - Expected Fail: 0 - Unexpected Success: 0 - Failed: 0 Sum of execute time for each test: 715.6658 sec.
