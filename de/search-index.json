big and small features are constantly being added to OSISM.

In blog posts with the tag Sneak Peak, we will now write about new features before the next major release. This blog entry is specifically about the possibility of deploying services on the recently integrated Kubernetes cluster. The deployment of services on the integrated Kubernetes cluster will be possible in future via the kubernetes environment.

When operating REGIO.cloud, we often come across tasks in our day-to-day business that we can already solve with the help of OSISM. If not, we open an issue for the task and build it in so that we can solve it directly in OSISM in the future. In blog posts with the tag Machine Room, we will now write about such tasks and how we were able to solve them with OSISM. Yesterday we had a hiccup in our RabbitMQ cluster. This has caused problems with the attachment of volumes to instances during the night. After analyzing the problem, it was decided that only a restart of the nova_compute containers, which provide the Nova Compute Service, would solve the problem. With the play manage-container it is possible to run an action, e.g. restart, of a specific container. As we have our compute nodes in housings, we have also mapped them in the inventory in inventory/10-custom and can now use those groups to restart all Nova Compute services one by one. $ osism apply manage-container \\ -e container_action=restart \\ -e container_name=nova_compute \\ -l housing1047 2024-01-12 08:28:55 | INFO | Task was prepared for execution.

A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory below the environments directory of the configuration repository with a special name. A sub-environment for Ceph always has the name ceph.NAME. The ceph.NAME directory in the configuration repository then contains the configuration.yml, images.yml and secrets.yml files as usual. In this example, a sub-environment ceph.rgw is created which is used for a Ceph cluster that will only be used as an RGW cluster.

Any other groups can be used, e.g. ceph.rgw.osd. It is recommended to base the name of the groups on the name of the sub-environments.

With OSISM, it is possible to manage any number of independent loadbalancers via a single OSISM manager service using sub-environments. A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory below the environments directory of the configuration repository with a special name. A sub-environment for an additional loadbalancer always has the name kolla.NAME as the loadbalancer is provided as part of Kolla. The kolla.NAME directory in the configuration repository then contains the configuration.yml, images.yml and secrets.yml files as usual. The following directories and files are also required in a sub-environment for a loadbalancer. File Description certificates/ca/custom.crt The file is optional. If a custom CA is used, it must be added here. certificates/haproxy-internal.pem SSL certificate to be used. files/overlays/haproxy/services.d/haproxy.cfg HAProxy configuration to be used on the loadbalancer. In this example, a sub-environment kolla.external is created, which is used for an outward facing loadbalancer that only offers certain API services. In comparison to the normal kolla environment, the groups to be used must be overwritten for a Kolla sub-environment. In this case, one group is defined: kolla.external.loadbalancer. It is recommended to base the name of the groups on the name of the sub-environments. The group kolla.external.loadbalancer is added to the global inventory in the 10-custom file. In this example, testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz is used for the second loadbalancer. inventory/10-custom [kolla.external.loadbalancer] testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz It is also important to ensure that the nodes used for the second loadbalancer are not included in the loadbalancer group. This can be checked with osism get hosts -l loadbalancer. If the nodes of the second loadbalancer are also listed there, the loadbalancer group in the 99-overwrite file of the global inventory must be overwritten. In this example, the loadbalaner group is overwritten so that only testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz and testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz are left in the loadbalancer group. inventory/99-overwrite [loadbalancer] testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz Furthermore, in a Kolla sub-environment that is only used for a loadbalancer, only a few additional parameters are required in the configuration.yml file. Don't get confused, only the kolla_*internal* parameters and the haproxy-internal.pem file are used here in the example. This is because we only want to configure one virtual IP address on the external loadbalancer and the loadbalancer managed by Kolla has the internal IP address by default. It is therefore not possible with Kolla to use only the kolla_*external* parameters as an additional virtual IP address with default values would then be configured by default. environments/kolla.external/configuration.yml --- ########################################################## # hosts hosts_kolla_all: kolla.external.loadbalancer hosts_kolla_loadbalancer: kolla.external.loadbalancer ########################################################## # docker docker_namespace: osism ########################################################## # loadbalancer kolla_internal_vip_address: 192.168.24.200 kolla_internal_fqdn: api.testbed.osism.com kolla_enable_tls_internal: \"yes\" # Required if a custom CA is used. kolla_copy_ca_into_containers: \"yes\" At the moment it is only possible to deploy the loadbalancer itself with its own configuration.

OSISM will generally look for files in environments/kolla/files/overlays/CONFIGFILE, environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/CONFIGFILE or environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/HOSTNAME/CONFIGFILE in the configuration repository. These locations sometimes vary and you should check the config task in the appropriate Ansible role for a full list of supported locations. For example, in the case of nova.conf the following locations are supported, assuming that you have services using nova.conf running on hosts called ctl1, ctl2 and ctl3: environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl1/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl2/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl3/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf Using this mechanism, overrides can be configured per-project (Nova), per-project-service (Nova scheduler service) or per-project-service-on-specified-host (Nova servies on ctl1). Overriding an option is as simple as setting the option under the relevant section. For example, to set override scheduler_max_attempts in the Nova scheduler service, the operator could create environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [DEFAULT] scheduler_max_attempts = 100 If the operator wants to configure the initial disk, cpu and ram allocation ratio on compute node com1, the operator needs to create the file environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/com1/nova.conf with this content: [DEFAULT] initial_cpu_allocation_ratio = 3.0 initial_ram_allocation_ratio = 1.0 initial_disk_allocation_ratio = 1.0 Note that the numbers shown here with an initial_cpu_allocation_ratio of 3.0 do match the requirements of the SCS-nV-* (moderate oversubscription) flavors. If you do not use SMT/hyperthreading, SCS would allow 5.0 here (for the V flavors). This method of merging configuration sections is supported for all services using oslo.config, which includes the vast majority of OpenStack services, and in some cases for services using YAML configuration. Since the INI format is an informal standard, not all INI files can be merged in this way. In these cases OSISM supports overriding the entire config file. Additional flexibility can be introduced by using Jinja conditionals in the config files. For example, you may create Nova cells which are homogeneous with respect to the hypervisor model. In each cell, you may wish to configure the hypervisors differently, for example the following override shows one way of setting the bandwidth_poll_interval variable as a function of the cell: [DEFAULT] {% if 'cell0001' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 100 {% elif 'cell0002' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = -1 {% else %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 300 {% endif %} An alternative to Jinja conditionals would be to define a variable for the bandwidth_poll_interval and set it in according to your requirements in the inventory group or host vars: [DEFAULT] bandwidth_poll_interval = {{ bandwidth_poll_interval }} OSISM allows the operator to override configuration globally for all services. It will look for a file called environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository. For example to modify database pool size connection for all services, the operator needs to create environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [database] max_pool_size = 100","s":"Customization of the service configurations","u":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/","h":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/#customization-of-the-service-configurations","p":1204},{"i":1217,"t":"It is explained with example of OpenSearch Service how the configuration for OpenSearch is created and gets into the container.

More details in the Nova Configuration Guide. On the compute node, the local SSD to be used is formatted with a file system of your choice and mounted to /var/lib/nova. When using more than one local SSD, a software RAID 1 should be used It is recommended to automate the creation of the file system and the creation of the mount point with a custom playbook. A nova.conf configuration file is created as an overlay file for the compute node testbed-node-0. The name of the directory must match the name of the host in the inventory. If the compute node has a file with the name testbed-node-0.yml in the host_vars directory in the inventory, then the name of the directory in the overlays is testbed-node-0 accordingly.

Important Ceph doesn't support QCOW2 for hosting a virtual machine disk.

It is possible to set a quota multiplier for any project. The following command you set a multiplier of 256 of the basic quota: $ openstack project set --property quotamultiplier=256 democompany-webshop Adjusting gigabyte quota for storage with a multiplier of 20 of the basic quota for a project: $ openstack project set --property quotamultiplier_storage=20 democompany-webshop This will override the general quotamultiplier only for storage. Other possible multiplier which can be set individually are: quotamultiplier_compute, quotamultiplier_network, quota_router To change the quotaclass to unlimited from the etc/classes.yaml $ openstack project set --property quotaclass=unlimited democompany-webshop Special project: images​ With this special Project you can share all images uploaded into this project to all other project in your domain which has set the property has-shared-images, which is by default set. Alsoi only the domain-admin user has access to this project, other domain users won't see this, they will find the uploaded images in their projects.

That said, the setup is not depending on anything specific from openSUSE and should work on every modern Linux distribution. Setting it up again in a different environment using Debian 12 images avoids a few of the shortcuts that were used and thus should be very suitable instructions to get it working in general. The step by step instructions are covered here. Note: This is a rather classical snowflake setup -- we create a VM and do some manual configuration to get everything configured. Having it well documented here should make this more replicatable, and is an important precondition for more automation, but larger steps to full automate this using ansible or helm charts (in a containerized variant) are not addressed here. As we expect a successor project for the increasingly hard to maintain shell code, this may not be worth the trouble. openstack-health-monitor implements a scripted scenario test with a large shell-script that uses the openstackclient tools to set up the scenario, test it and tear everything down again in a loop. Any errors are recorded, as well as timings and some very basic benchmarks. The script sets up some virtual network infrastructure (routers, networks, subnets, floating IPs), security groups, keypairs, volumes and finally boots some VMs. Access to these is tested (ensuring metadata injection works) and connectivity between them tested and measured. A loadbalancer (optionally) is set up with a health-monitor and access via it before and after killing some backends is tested. The scenario is described in a bit more detail in the repository's README.md file. The openstack-health-monitor is not the intended long-term solution for monitoring your infrastructure. The SCS project has a project underway that will create more modern, flexible, and more maintainable monitoring infrastructure; the concepts are described on the monitoring section of the project's documentation. The openstack-health-monitor will thus not see any significant enhancements any more; it will be maintained and kept alive as long as there are users.

If the cloud goes down, we will no longer see API calls against it, although the information of them not being available does not reveal much in terms of insight into the reasons for the outage. Also, the driver VM is the only long-lived VM in the openstack-health-monitor setup, so it may be useful to have it in the same cloud to reveal any issues that do not occur on the short-lived resources created and deleted by the health-monitor.

The openstack-health-monitor is carefully designed to not clean up anything that it has not created. There is however some trickiness, as not all resources have names (floating IPs for example do not) and sometimes names need to be assigned after creation of a resource (volumes of diskless flavors), so in case there are API errors, some heuristics is used to identify resources which may not be safe under all circumstances.

The script api_monitor.sh is the main worker of openstack-health-monitor and runs one to many iterations of a cycle where resources are created, tested and torn down. Its operation is described in the README.md file. It is good practice to use tmux. This allows you to return (reattach) to console sessions and to open new windows to investigate things. Traditional people may prefer to screen over tmux. You should be ready to run one iteration of the openstack-health-monitor now. Run it like this: export IMG=\"Debian 12\" export JHIMG=\"Debian 12\" ./api_monitor.sh -O -C -D -n 6 -s -b -B -M -T -LL -i 1 Leave out the -LL if you don't have a working loadbalancer service or replace -LL with -LO if you want to test the ovn loadbalancer instead of amphorae (saving quite some resources). Feel free to study the meaning of all the command line parameters by looking at the README.md. (Note: Many of the things enabled by the parameters should be default, but are not for historic reasons. This would change if we rewrite this whole thing in python.) This will run for ~7 minutes, depending on the performance of your OpenStack environment. You should not get any error. (The amber-colored outputs DOWN, BUILD, creating are not errors. Nothing in red should be displayed.) Studying the console output may be instructive to follow the script's progress. You may also open another window (remember the tmux recommendation above) and look at the resources with the usual openstack RESOURCE list and openstack RESOURCE show NAME and RESOURCE being something like router, network, subnet, port, volume, server, floating ip, loadbalancer, loadbalancer pool, loadbalancer listener, security group, keypair, image, ...) The api_monitor.sh uses and APIMonitor_TIMESTAMP prefix for all OpenStack resource names. This allows to identify the created resources and clean them up even if things go wrong. TIMESTAMP is an integer number representing the seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (Unix time). This may be the time to check that you have sufficient quota to create the resources. While we only create 6+N VMs (and volumes) with the above call (N being the number of AZs), we would want to increase this number for larger clouds. For single-AZ deployments, we would want to still use 2 networks at least -N 2 to test the ability of the router to route traffic between networks. So expect -n 6 to become -N 2 -n 6 for a very small single-AZ cloud or -n 12 for a large 3 AZ cloud region.

So when you run api_monitor.sh in a loop (which you will) with say 10 VMs (e.g. -N 2 -n 8) in each iteration and run this for an hour with 8 iterations, you will never have more than 10 VMs in parallel and they only are alive a bit more than half of the time, but rather than being charged for ~6 VM hours, you end up being charged for ~80 VM hours. Similar for volumes, routers, floating IPs. This makes a huge difference. Sometimes the cloud under test has issues. That's why we do monitoring ... One thing that might happen is that loadbalancers and volumes (and other resources, but those two are the most prone to this) end up in a broken state that can not be cleaned up by the user any more.

(IANAL, but charging for providing something that is not working is not typically supported by civil law in most jurisdictions and T&Cs that would say so would not normally be legally enforceable.)

Once you have configured postfix, you can enable eMail notifications using the option -e. Using it twice allows you to differentiate between notes (statistical summaries) and errors.

Enable influx database in grafana​ In the dashboard, go to Home, Connections, choose InfluxDB and Add new datasource. The defaults (database name, InfluxQL query language) work. You need to explicitly set the URL to http://localhost:8086 (despite this being the suggestion). Set the database name to telegraf. Save&test should succeed. Importing the dashboard​ Go to Home, Dashboards, New, Import. Upload the dashboard .json file from the repository, user the Grafana-10 variant if you use Grafana 10 or newer. In the dashboard, go to the settings gear wheel, variables, mycloud and add CLOUDNAME to the list of clouds that can be displayed. (There are some existing SCS clouds in that list.) Save. Now choose CLOUDNAME as cloud (top of the dashboard, rightmost dropdown for the mycloud filter variable). No data displayed?​ Sometimes, you may see a panel displaying \"no data\" despite the fact that the first full iteration of data has been sent to influx already. This may be a strange interaction between the browser and Grafana -- we have not analyzed whether that is a bug in Grafana. One way to work around is to go into the setting of the panel (the three dots in the upper right corner), go to edit and start changing one aspect of the query. Apply. Change it back to the original. Apply. The data will appear. Save to be sure it's conserved. Dashboard features​ Look at the top line filters: You can filter to only see certain API calls or certain resources; the graphs are very crowded and filtering to better see what you want to focus on is very well intended. The first row of panels give a health impression; there are absolute numbers as well as percentage numbers and the panels turn amber and red in case you have too many errors. Note that the colors on the panels with absolute numbers can not take into account whether you look at just a few hours or at weeks. Accordingly, consider the colors a reasonable hint if things are green or not when looking at a ~24 hours interval. This limitation does not affect the colors on the percentage graph, obviously. You can change the time interval and zoom in also by marking an interval with the mouse. Zooming out to a few months can be a very useful feature to see trends and watch e.g. your API performance, your resource creation times or the benchmarks change over the long term. github OIDC integration​ The SCS providers do allow all github users that belong to the SovereignCloudStack organization to get Viewer access to the dashboards by adding a client_id and client_secret in the [github.auth] section that you request from the SCS github admins (github's oauth auth). This allows to exchange experience and to get a feeling for the achievable stability. (Hint: A single digit number of API call fails per week and no other failures is achievable on loaded clouds.)","s":"grafana","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#grafana","p":1642},{"i":1684,"t":"Install influxdb via apt: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/introduction/install/#installing-influxdb-oss Install telegraf (same apt repo as influxdb): sudo apt update && sudo apt install telegraf Install grafana: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/#install-from-apt-repository Prepare configuration by using the config files from the repository as an alternative to doing the changes manually (as described above): sudo cp dashboard/telegraf.conf /etc/telegraf && sudo chown root:root /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf && sudo chmod 0644 /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf sudo cp dashboard/config.toml /etc/influxdb && sudo chown root:influxdb /etc/influxdb/config.toml && sudo chmod 0640 /etc/influxdb/config.toml sudo cp dashboard/grafana.ini /etc/grafana && sudo chown root:grafana /etc/grafana/grafana.ini && sudo chmod 0640 /etc/grafana/grafana.ini These config files should work as long as the versions of telegraf, influxdb and grafana don't evolve too far from the ones used in the repository.

There are a few things that may need support from a cloud admin: Volumes may end up permanently in a deleting or reserved state or may be in-use, attached to a VM that has long gone.

For the osismclient container /change.sh osism <git branch> for the osism/python-osism repository For the inventory-reonciler container /change.sh osism <git branch> for the osism/python-osism repository /change.sh generics <git branch> for the osism/cfg-generics repository /change.sh defaults <git branch> for the osism/defaults repository /change.sh release <git branch> for the osism/release repository For the osism-ansible container /change.sh osism <git branch> for the osism/python-osism repository /change.sh playbooks <git branch> for the osism/ansible-playbooks repository /change.sh [services|commons|validations] <git branch> for the osism/ansible-collection-services, osism/ansible-collection-commons, and osism/ansible-collection-validations repositories For the ceph-ansible container /change.sh osism <git branch> for the osism/python-osism repository /change.sh operations <git branch> for the osism/kolla-operations repository For the kolla-ansible container /change.sh osism <git branch> for the osism/python-osism repository /change.sh operations <git branch> for the osism/kolla-operations repository /change.sh kolla-ansible <git branch> for the openstack/kolla-ansible repository In this example, the main branch of osism/ansible-collection-services is used in the osism-ansible container. docker exec -u root -it osism-ansible /change.sh services main The respective container should always be restarted after a change. docker restart osism-ansible If something has been changed in the defaults and is to be tested, this must be changed in the inventory reconciler service. Regardless of which of the Ansible services the customised defaults are intended for. docker exec -u root -it manager-inventory_reconciler-1 /change.sh defaults main docker restart manager-inventory_reconciler-1","s":"Scripts","u":"/de/docs/guides/other-guides/developer-guide/scripts","h":"","p":1761},{"i":1765,"t":"We implement all the default rules of Ansible Lint.

Request access from the administrator of the respective cloud or get access to an OpenStack cloud. Clone the osism/testbed repository. The repository can also be cloned to any other location. mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/osism git clone https://github.com/osism/testbed ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed cd ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed Configure your cloud access profile The access data for the cloud provider used is stored in terraform/clouds.yaml and (optionally) in terraform/secure.yaml (same structure, if you want to store credentials on a separate place). In file terraform/clouds.yaml.sample you will find examples of typical setups. Settings that are identical for all users of a cloud can be defined centrally via the profiles of the file terraform/clouds-public.yaml. You can reference these settings by using the profile parameter in cloud-specific definition in terraform/clouds.yaml. The user specific settings of the clouds.yaml file are provided by the cloud provider. Please check the documentation of the cloud provider you are using or their support for details. REGIO.cloud is used as an example here. The cloud name in clouds.yaml and the environment name (value of ENVIRONMENT) are regiocloud in this case. It is important that the name of the cloud in clouds.yaml matches the name of the environment to be used. The names must be identical. It is currently not possible to name the cloud regiocloud-123 in clouds.yaml if the environment is regiocloud. If another cloud is used, replace regiocloud with the respective profile name from the table above. Application Credentials Username/Password The use of application credentials is preferred. This way it is not necessary to store details like username, project name or sensitive information like the password in the clouds.yaml file. The application credentials can be found in Horizon under Identity. Use OSISM Testbed as name and click Create Application Credential. terraform/clouds.yaml clouds: regiocloud: profile: regiocloud auth: application_credential_id: ID application_credential_secret: SECRET auth_type: \"v3applicationcredential\" If you want to make use of terraform/secure.yaml add your application credential secret there instead of terraform/clouds.yaml. terraform/secure.yaml clouds: regiocloud: auth: application_credential_secret: SECRET terraform/clouds.yaml clouds: regiocloud: profile: regiocloud auth: project_name: PROJECT username: USERNAME project_domain_name: DOMAIN user_domain_name: DOMAIN If you want to make use of terraform/secure.yaml add your password there instead of terraform/clouds.yaml. terraform/secure.yaml clouds: regiocloud: auth: password: PASSWORD Prepare the deployment. The versions of Ansible and OpenTofu are managed automatically and necessary dependencies are cloned. make prepare If any error occurs during preparation and you want to run the preparation again, it is important to run make wipe-local-install first. Otherwise the preparation will not be redone completely and necessary parts will be missing later on. Create the infrastructure with OpenTofu. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud create Deploy the OSISM manager and bootstrap all nodes. Deploy latest manager version Deploy a stable manager version make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud manager make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud VERSION_MANAGER=7.0.3 manager After the bootstrap, you can log in to the manager via SSH. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login Yo can log in to the nodes of the cluster via the manager. osism console testbed-node-0 Deploy all services. Deployment in single steps Deployment of all services It is also possible to deploy the services step by step on the manager. To do this, first log in to the manager with make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login and then execute the deploy scripts one after the other. It is recommended to do this within a screen session. Deploying the services takes some time and depends on how much bandwidth is available, how the instances are equipped, etc. 90-120 minutes is not unusual when Ceph and OpenStack are fully deployed. To speed up the Ansible playbooks, ARA can be disabled. This is done by executing /opt/configuration/scripts/disable-ara.sh. Run this script before the deployment scripts. Afterwards no more logs are available in the ARA web interface. To re-enable ARA use /opt/configuration/scripts/enable-ara.sh. There is also the option of pre-population of images with /opt/configuration/scripts/pull-images.sh so that deployments do not have to be lengthy. Run this script before the deployment scripts. /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/001-helper-services.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/005-kubernetes.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-ceph-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/200-infrastructure-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/300-openstack-services-basic.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring-services.sh Prepare OpenStack resources like public network, flavors and images by running /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap.sh. Run this script after the deployment scripts. info If you only want to deploy the monitoring services with /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring-services.sh, a few dependencies must be deployed first. You can then use the monitoring services without having to install a complete OpenStack & Ceph environment. osism apply common osism apply loadbalancer osism apply opensearch osism apply mariadb In this single step deployment, Ceph, OpenStack and all necessary infrastructure services (MariaDB, RabbitMQ, ...) are deployed. Depending on the cloud, the deployment will take some time. Up to two hours is not unusual. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud deploy If you want to verify the deployment with refstack run /opt/configuration/scripts/check.sh. This step will take some time and is optional. The machine images required for the use of Kubernetes Cluster API and the amphora driver of OpenStack Octavia service are not provided by default to save resources on the OSISM Testbed and improve deployment time. These can be provisioned if required. /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap/301-openstack-octavia-amhpora-image.sh /opt/configuration/scripts/bootstrap/302-openstack-k8s-clusterapi-images.sh If you want you can create a test project with a test user after login. It also creates an instance with a volume attached to a network with a router. This step is optional. osism apply --environment openstack test When the OSISM Testbed is no longer needed, it can be deleted. make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud clean","s":"Deployment","u":"/de/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed","h":"/de/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed#deployment","p":1818},{"i":1830,"t":"Deployment must be completed at this point.","s":"Usage","u":"/de/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed","h":"/de/docs/guides/other-guides/testbed#usage","p":1818},{"i":1832,"t":"The OSISM Testbed deployment currently uses hostnames in the domain testbed.osism.xyz.

The 5: prefix is placed in front of the version. Commit and push the changes to your configuration repository afterwards. The upgrade of Docker is then done with the OSISM CLI. Docker on the manager itself is updated differently. This does not work on the manager itself because the Docker service may be started during the upgrade and individual containers may be started as a result. This would interrupt the run of the role itself. osism apply docker -l 'docker:!manager' By default, serial is set to 1 so that the the hosts are upgrade one after the other. To adjust this, either use the osism_serial dictionary in the environments/configuration.yml file to change the value in docker or append -e serial=10% to upgrade, for example, 10% with each iteration. Please note that it is not a good idea to upgrade more than one Docker service at a time. This can lead to anomalies, especially on storage nodes and control nodes. It is recommended not to change the default of 1. osism_serial: docker: 10% On the manager itself, the run.sh script in the manager environment of the configuration must currently be used to upgrade the Docker service.

As a result, it can come to a restart of the running containers. This can lead to interruptions in individual services. A change in /etc/docker/daemon.json due to a new configuration parameter etc. can also result in a required restart. Whether the containers are restarted when the Docker Service is restarted depends on whether the Live Restore feature is used. This can be configured via the parameter docker_live_restore. Live restore is enabled by default. It is important to set the docker_live_restore parameter explicitly as a string. This means docker_live_restore: \"false\" or docker_live_restore: \"true\". But even if the Live Restore feature is enabled, certain upgrades will cause running containers to be restarted: Live restore allows you to keep containers running across Docker daemon updates, but is only supported when installing patch releases (YY.MM.x), not for major (YY.MM) daemon upgrades. There are two ways to prevent a restart of the Docker service during an upgrade. If the restart behaviour of the Docker service is changed, always make sure to restart the Docker service manually afterwards (e.g. by a system reboot). A host group can be defined via the parameter docker_ignore_restart_groupname. The restart of the Docker service is not triggered for all hosts in this group. By default, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to manager. The parameter is best set in the environments/configuration.yml file when making an adjustment. For example, to prevent the restart on all hosts, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to generic. docker_ignore_restart_groupname: generic With the parameter docker_allow_restart, the restart of the Docker service can be prevented. By default, docker_allow_restart is set to true. It is recommended to set this parameter only at runtime. Otherwise, the best place for the parameter is the environments/configuration.yml file. osism apply docker -e docker_allow_restart=false","s":"Restart behaviour","u":"/de/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/docker","h":"/de/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/docker#restart-behaviour","p":1887},{"i":1892,"t":"Open vSwitch (OVS) osism apply -a pull openvswitch osism apply -a upgrade openvswitch Open Virtual Network (OVN) In environments/kolla/configuration.yml the parameter neutron_plugin_agent is set to ovn if OVN is used as a network plugin.

Read the release notes even if you are only updating from e.g. 7.0.2 to 7.0.5. The update of a manager service with a stable release of OSISM is described here. In the example, OSISM release 7.0.5 is used. Change the OSISM release in the configuration repository. 1.1. Set the new OSISM version in the configuration repository. MANAGER_VERSION=7.0.5 sed -i -e \"s/manager_version: .*/manager_version: ${MANAGER_VERSION}/g\" environments/manager/configuration.yml 1.2. If openstack_version or ceph_version are set in environments/manager/configuration.yml (or anywhere else), they must be removed. If these are set, the stable release is not used for these components. 1.3. Sync the image versions and files in the configuration repository. OSISM >= 7.0.0 OSISM < 7.0.0 make sync If Gilt is not installed via the requirements.txt of the manager environment it is important to use a version smaller v2. The v2 of Gilt is not yet usable. gilt overlay # you have to do this 2x, this is not a copy & paste error gilt overlay Optionally, this is normally not necessary, it is possible to reference a specific tag of the osism/cfg-generics repository. To do this, first check which version of osism/cfg-generics is used in a particular release. The version is defined in generics_version in the base.yml file in the osism/release repository. For OSISM 6.0.0, for example, this is version v0.20230919.0. This version is then added to the file gilt.yml in the configuration repository instead of main at version. This change must be made again after each execution of gilt overlay as it is overwritten by the call of gilt overlay. This cannot be realized differently in the current implementation of Gilt. 1.4. Commit and push all changes in the configuration repository. Since everyone here has their own workflows for changes to the configuration repository, only a generic example for Git. git commit -a -s -m \"manager: use OSISM version 7.0.5\" git push Update the configuration repository on the manager node. osism apply configuration Update the manager service on the manager node. osism update manager If Ansible Vault was used to encrypt environments/manager/secrets.yml, the parameter --ask-vault-pass is also appended.

Usually security groups are assigned to the Port(s) when a virtual machine is created, but assignments can also be changed at runtime later on. Multiple security groups can be assigned to a VM or Port simultaneously and in such case they will be combined as the union of all their rules. caution Security groups are mutable resources.

Use this information to identify all incoming and outgoing traffic rules that will be needed based on the communication patterns of the services it is meant to deploy. This includes communication protocols, port numbers, communication directions and optionally target/source address ranges. Look through already existing security groups and their rules. If a security group allows more traffic than needed it SHOULD NOT be used. If a security group contains only a subset of the required rules it MAY be used in combination with other security groups that contain rules which fulfill the remaining required traffic rules from point 1. If you were not successful in finding an appropriate combination of existing security groups or you need additional specific rules to cover all requirements, you MAY create one or more new Security Groups in which you can add the required rules.

But that only should be done while also restricting the SSH configuration to public key authentication only (the recommended way) or having a strong username and password policy already applied to the operating system of the virtual machine. Otherwise default usernames and passwords which are often preconfigured in system images may be exploited through the exposed SSH port which enables attackers to compromise the virtual machine. ICMP It might be useful to be able to ping a virtual machine or use other ICMP requests. But for some virtual machine configurations this is either not necessary at all or only temporarily needed.

Overwriting an existing volume with the backup data. note If the volume backup was originally created from a volume that used a non-default encrypted volume type, letting Cinder Backup create a new volume for backup restoration does not work and the volume type must match exactly.

Restoring an encrypted volume backup (Cinder Backup)​ When restoring a volume backup of a volume that was using a non-default encrypted volume type, a new volume of that type needs to be created first and then the backup restored onto it. Otherwise, the restoration will fail with the target volume ending up in the \"error_restoring\" state. For this procedure to succeed it is necessary to know the exact volume type of the volume the backup was created from. If the source volume of the backup still exists, the original volume type can be determined by inspecting the backup's volume_id attribute and then using it to look up the corresponding volume and its type attribute. The following client command can be used for this (fill in the value for BACKUP_ID): export BACKUP_ID=... SOURCE_VOLUME_ID=\"$(openstack volume backup show $BACKUP_ID -f value -c volume_id)\" openstack volume show -f value -c type \"$SOURCE_VOLUME_ID\" This returns the name of the original volume type.

By default, only one Ceph service is restarted at a time. This can be adjusted with the ceph_handler_*_restart_throttle parameters. The default value is 1. ceph_handler_crash_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mdss_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mgrs_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mons_restart_throttle ceph_handler_osds_restart_throttle ceph_handler_rbdmirrors_restart_throttle ceph_handler_rgws_restart_throttle OVN container images will be built without the -march=broadwell parameter in the future. The OVN images have not been updated with this release, this only serves as an announcement for the future. By removing the parameter, it is possible to use the OVN container images on older CPUs. It is planned to provide different variants of the OVN and OVS container images in the future to enable parameters for modern CPUs in order to improve performance in particular. This has nothing to do with the release itself and is just a notice. The build of the OpenStack Zed images has been disabled.","s":"7.0.3 (20240503)","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#703-20240503","p":1999},{"i":2008,"t":"Release date: 17.

The Keycloak deployment via Docker Compose, which was previously included as a technical preview, has been completely revised and is now deployed on Kubernetes. No migration from the old deployment via Docker Compose to the new deployment via Kubernetes has been prepared. If you are currently using the Keycloak service, do not upgrade the Keycloak service and contact us in advance. The Keystone role service is required by a number of OpenStack services. The role has been created automatically with new deployments for some time now. It is possible that this role is not yet available on older deployments and must be created once in preparation for the upgrade. You can check whether the role is available in the output of openstack --os-cloud admin role list. If it does not exist, it can be created with openstack --os-cloud admin role create service.

When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to upgrade MariaDB first. When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to perform the loadbalancer upgrade before all OpenStack service upgrades. To make sure that the OpenStack services continue to work after the upgrade when ProxySQL is enabled as part of the upgrade, the ProxySQL service must have been deployed first. The ProxySQL service is deployed with the loadbalancer play. It is possible that connectivity with the database may be interrupted for a short time during the migration.

In an upcoming release, the parameters can be removed from the infrastructure environment. The Ansible callback plugin osism.commons.still_alive is now available to avoid timeouts for long-running tasks. This currently has to be explicitly enabled in the Ansible configuration. This is done in the environments/ansible.cfg file in the configuration repository. The callback plugin is enabled by default in the future. After this change has been made, the update of the manager must be performed. A manager with a version before OSISM 7.0.0 cannot be longer used if this plugin is set in environments/ansible.cfg. environments/ansible.cfg [defaults] ... stdout_callback = osism.commons.still_alive In the inventory, the nova_backend parameter must be added to the host vars of compute nodes where local storage is used. nova_backend: default The SSL certificate file haproxy.pem is now available in a different location in the haproxy container. Previously it was stored under /etc/haproxy/haproxy.pem. From now on it is stored under /etc/haproxy/certificates/haproxy.pem. If you have customised the configuration for the haproxy service or use overlays for this, adjust the locations of the SSL certificate as required. Due to the upgrade from Fluentd to version 5, some directory names within the container image for Fluentd have changed. If you have worked with overlay files in the Fluentd service, check these in advance. Currently we know that /var/run/td-agent is now available as /var/run/fluentd (check osism/issues#864 for details). We assume that other directory names have changed similarly. If a Keystone domain with LDAP backend is used, it is important to add the tls_cacertfile parameter in the [ldap] section of the corresponding domain configuration. [ldap] ... tls_cacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt The management of Ceph pools and Ceph clients/keys has been moved to a separate play ceph-pools.
