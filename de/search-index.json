not only develop OSISM, we also use it to operate our own cloud infrastructure, the REGIO.cloud. When operating REGIO.cloud, we often come across tasks in our day-to-day business that we can already solve with the help of OSISM. If not, we open an issue for the task and build it in so that we can solve it directly in OSISM in the future. In blog posts with the tag Machine Room, we will now write about such tasks and how we were able to solve them with OSISM. Yesterday we had a hiccup in our RabbitMQ cluster. This has caused problems with the attachment of volumes to instances during the night. After analyzing the problem, it was decided that only a restart of the nova_compute containers, which provide the Nova Compute Service, would solve the problem. With the play manage-container it is possible to run an action, e.g. restart, of a specific container. As we have our compute nodes in housings, we have also mapped them in the inventory in inventory/10-custom and can now use those groups to restart all Nova Compute services one by one. $ osism apply manage-container \\ -e container_action=restart \\ -e container_name=nova_compute \\ -l housing1047 2024-01-12 08:28:55 | INFO | Task was prepared for execution.

In blog posts with the tag Sneak Peak, we will now write about new features before the next major release. This blog entry is specifically about the possibility of deploying services on the recently integrated Kubernetes cluster.

A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory below the environments directory of the configuration repository with a special name. A sub-environment for Ceph always has the name ceph.NAME. The ceph.NAME directory in the configuration repository then contains the configuration.yml, images.yml and secrets.yml files as usual. In this example, a sub-environment ceph.rgw is created which is used for a Ceph cluster that will only be used as an RGW cluster. In comparison to the normal ceph environment, the groups to be used must be overwritten for a Ceph sub-environment. In this case, two groups are defined: ceph.rgw and ceph.rgw.empty. Any other groups can be used, e.g. ceph.rgw.osd. It is recommended to base the name of the groups on the name of the sub-environments.

With OSISM, it is possible to manage any number of independent loadbalancers via a single OSISM manager service using sub-environments. A sub environment is basically nothing more than another directory below the environments directory of the configuration repository with a special name. A sub-environment for an additional loadbalancer always has the name kolla.NAME as the loadbalancer is provided as part of Kolla. The kolla.NAME directory in the configuration repository then contains the configuration.yml, images.yml and secrets.yml files as usual. The following directories and files are also required in a sub-environment for a loadbalancer. File Description certificates/ca/custom.crt The file is optional. If a custom CA is used, it must be added here. certificates/haproxy-internal.pem SSL certificate to be used. files/overlays/haproxy/services.d/haproxy.cfg HAProxy configuration to be used on the loadbalancer. In this example, a sub-environment kolla.external is created, which is used for an outward facing loadbalancer that only offers certain API services. In comparison to the normal kolla environment, the groups to be used must be overwritten for a Kolla sub-environment. In this case, one group is defined: kolla.external.loadbalancer. It is recommended to base the name of the groups on the name of the sub-environments. The group kolla.external.loadbalancer is added to the global inventory in the 10-custom file. In this example, testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz is used for the second loadbalancer. inventory/10-custom [kolla.external.loadbalancer] testbed-node-2.testbed.osism.xyz It is also important to ensure that the nodes used for the second loadbalancer are not included in the loadbalancer group. This can be checked with osism get hosts -l loadbalancer. If the nodes of the second loadbalancer are also listed there, the loadbalancer group in the 99-overwrite file of the global inventory must be overwritten. In this example, the loadbalaner group is overwritten so that only testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz and testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz are left in the loadbalancer group. inventory/99-overwrite [loadbalancer] testbed-node-0.testbed.osism.xyz testbed-node-1.testbed.osism.xyz Furthermore, in a Kolla sub-environment that is only used for a loadbalancer, only a few additional parameters are required in the configuration.yml file. Don't get confused, only the kolla_*internal* parameters and the haproxy-internal.pem file are used here in the example. This is because we only want to configure one virtual IP address on the external loadbalancer and the loadbalancer managed by Kolla has the internal IP address by default. It is therefore not possible with Kolla to use only the kolla_*external* parameters as an additional virtual IP address with default values would then be configured by default. environments/kolla.external/configuration.yml --- ########################################################## # hosts hosts_kolla_all: kolla.external.loadbalancer hosts_kolla_loadbalancer: kolla.external.loadbalancer ########################################################## # docker docker_namespace: osism ########################################################## # loadbalancer kolla_internal_vip_address: 192.168.24.200 kolla_internal_fqdn: api.testbed.osism.com kolla_enable_tls_internal: \"yes\" # Required if a custom CA is used. kolla_copy_ca_into_containers: \"yes\" At the moment it is only possible to deploy the loadbalancer itself with its own configuration.

OSISM will generally look for files in environments/kolla/files/overlays/CONFIGFILE, environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/CONFIGFILE or environments/kolla/files/overlays/SERVICENAME/HOSTNAME/CONFIGFILE in the configuration repository. These locations sometimes vary and you should check the config task in the appropriate Ansible role for a full list of supported locations. For example, in the case of nova.conf the following locations are supported, assuming that you have services using nova.conf running on hosts called ctl1, ctl2 and ctl3: environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl1/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl2/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/ctl3/nova.conf environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf Using this mechanism, overrides can be configured per-project (Nova), per-project-service (Nova scheduler service) or per-project-service-on-specified-host (Nova servies on ctl1). Overriding an option is as simple as setting the option under the relevant section. For example, to set override scheduler_max_attempts in the Nova scheduler service, the operator could create environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/nova-scheduler.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [DEFAULT] scheduler_max_attempts = 100 If the operator wants to configure the initial disk, cpu and ram allocation ratio on compute node com1, the operator needs to create the file environments/kolla/files/overlays/nova/com1/nova.conf with this content: [DEFAULT] initial_cpu_allocation_ratio = 3.0 initial_ram_allocation_ratio = 1.0 initial_disk_allocation_ratio = 1.0 Note that the numbers shown here with an initial_cpu_allocation_ratio of 3.0 do match the requirements of the SCS-nV-* (moderate oversubscription) flavors. If you do not use SMT/hyperthreading, SCS would allow 5.0 here (for the V flavors). This method of merging configuration sections is supported for all services using oslo.config, which includes the vast majority of OpenStack services, and in some cases for services using YAML configuration. Since the INI format is an informal standard, not all INI files can be merged in this way. In these cases OSISM supports overriding the entire config file. Additional flexibility can be introduced by using Jinja conditionals in the config files. For example, you may create Nova cells which are homogeneous with respect to the hypervisor model. In each cell, you may wish to configure the hypervisors differently, for example the following override shows one way of setting the bandwidth_poll_interval variable as a function of the cell: [DEFAULT] {% if 'cell0001' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 100 {% elif 'cell0002' in group_names %} bandwidth_poll_interval = -1 {% else %} bandwidth_poll_interval = 300 {% endif %} An alternative to Jinja conditionals would be to define a variable for the bandwidth_poll_interval and set it in according to your requirements in the inventory group or host vars: [DEFAULT] bandwidth_poll_interval = {{ bandwidth_poll_interval }} OSISM allows the operator to override configuration globally for all services. It will look for a file called environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository. For example to modify database pool size connection for all services, the operator needs to create environments/kolla/files/overlays/global.conf in the configuration repository with this content: [database] max_pool_size = 100","s":"Customization of the service configurations","u":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/","h":"/de/docs/guides/configuration-guide/openstack/#customization-of-the-service-configurations","p":1272},{"i":1285,"t":"It is explained with example of OpenSearch Service how the configuration for OpenSearch is created and gets into the container.

We prefer the use of software RAIDs to make us less dependent on hardware. But there is nothing against using hardware RAIDs. The use of a LVM2 is recommended. system is recommended as the name for the volume group. Dedicated disks may be provided for /var/lib/docker on the controller nodes. In this case, do not use an LV for /var/lib/docker but the devices provided for it. Do not configure devices that are not required for the operating system. The use of own file systems for the following mountpoints is recommended. The size of the partitions/LVs is minimal. Depending on the node type, the partitions/LVs should be made larger. / (10 GByte, logical volume root) /home (2 GByte, logical volume home) /tmp (5 GByte, logical volume tmp) /var/lib/ceph (50 GByte, logical volume ceph) (optional for storage nodes) /var/lib/docker (30 GByte, logical volume docker, do not set the nosuid flag on /var/lib/docker) When using XFS as the file system for /var/lib/docker, note the following: Running on XFS without d_type support causes Docker to skip the attempt to use the overlay or overlay2 driver. 100 GB should be used on a control node at the beginning. /var/lib/docker must be extended later during operation depending on the node type. You do this in operation when you can see how many logs etc. are generated. /var/log/audit (1 GByte, logical volume audit) /var (10 GByte, logical volume var) swap (8 GByte, logical volume swap) Choose No automatic updates. Choose OpenSSH server as software to install. Do not install any other software component. Everything you need will be installed later by OSISM. In particular, it is not necessary to install a desktop environment.

Technically, you could use other QEMU-supported formats (such as qcow2 or vmdk), but doing so would add additional overhead, and would also render the volume unsafe for virtual machine live migration when caching (see below) is enabled. Important Ceph doesn't support QCOW2 for hosting a virtual machine disk.

That said, the setup is not depending on anything specific from openSUSE and should work on every modern Linux distribution. Setting it up again in a different environment using Debian 12 images avoids a few of the shortcuts that were used and thus should be very suitable instructions to get it working in general. The step by step instructions are covered here. Note: This is a rather classical snowflake setup -- we create a VM and do some manual configuration to get everything configured. Having it well documented here should make this more replicatable, and is an important precondition for more automation, but larger steps to full automate this using ansible or helm charts (in a containerized variant) are not addressed here. As we expect a successor project for the increasingly hard to maintain shell code, this may not be worth the trouble. openstack-health-monitor implements a scripted scenario test with a large shell-script that uses the openstackclient tools to set up the scenario, test it and tear everything down again in a loop. Any errors are recorded, as well as timings and some very basic benchmarks. The script sets up some virtual network infrastructure (routers, networks, subnets, floating IPs), security groups, keypairs, volumes and finally boots some VMs. Access to these is tested (ensuring metadata injection works) and connectivity between them tested and measured. A loadbalancer (optionally) is set up with a health-monitor and access via it before and after killing some backends is tested. The scenario is described in a bit more detail in the repository's README.md file. The openstack-health-monitor is not the intended long-term solution for monitoring your infrastructure. The SCS project has a project underway that will create more modern, flexible, and more maintainable monitoring infrastructure; the concepts are described on the monitoring section of the project's documentation. The openstack-health-monitor will thus not see any significant enhancements any more; it will be maintained and kept alive as long as there are users. This guide exclusively focuses on how to set it up.","s":"Intro","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#intro","p":1680},{"i":1685,"t":"So we start a Debian 12 image on a cloud of our choice.

If the cloud goes down, we will no longer see API calls against it, although the information of them not being available does not reveal much in terms of insight into the reasons for the outage. Also, the driver VM is the only long-lived VM in the openstack-health-monitor setup, so it may be useful to have it in the same cloud to reveal any issues that do not occur on the short-lived resources created and deleted by the health-monitor.

You can of course also query openstack on the status openstack server list or openstack server show oshm-driver.

Verify that your openstack CLI works: openstack catalog list openstack server list You can use the same project as you use for your driver VM (and possibly other workloads). The openstack-health-monitor is carefully designed to not clean up anything that it has not created. There is however some trickiness, as not all resources have names (floating IPs for example do not) and sometimes names need to be assigned after creation of a resource (volumes of diskless flavors), so in case there are API errors, some heuristics is used to identify resources which may not be safe under all circumstances. So ideally, you have an extra project created just for the health-monitor and configure the credentials for it here, so you can not possibly hit any wrong resource in the script's extensive efforts to clean up in error cases.","s":"Configuring openstack CLI on the driver VM","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#configuring-openstack-cli-on-the-driver-vm","p":1680},{"i":1695,"t":"If your cloud API's endpoints don't use TLS certificates that are signed by an official CA, you need to provide your CA to this VM and configure it.

The script api_monitor.sh is the main worker of openstack-health-monitor and runs one to many iterations of a cycle where resources are created, tested and torn down. Its operation is described in the README.md file. It is good practice to use tmux. This allows you to return (reattach) to console sessions and to open new windows to investigate things. Traditional people may prefer to screen over tmux. You should be ready to run one iteration of the openstack-health-monitor now. Run it like this: export IMG=\"Debian 12\" export JHIMG=\"Debian 12\" ./api_monitor.sh -O -C -D -n 6 -s -b -B -M -T -LL -i 1 Leave out the -LL if you don't have a working loadbalancer service or replace -LL with -LO if you want to test the ovn loadbalancer instead of amphorae (saving quite some resources). Feel free to study the meaning of all the command line parameters by looking at the README.md. (Note: Many of the things enabled by the parameters should be default, but are not for historic reasons. This would change if we rewrite this whole thing in python.) This will run for ~7 minutes, depending on the performance of your OpenStack environment. You should not get any error. (The amber-colored outputs DOWN, BUILD, creating are not errors. Nothing in red should be displayed.) Studying the console output may be instructive to follow the script's progress. You may also open another window (remember the tmux recommendation above) and look at the resources with the usual openstack RESOURCE list and openstack RESOURCE show NAME and RESOURCE being something like router, network, subnet, port, volume, server, floating ip, loadbalancer, loadbalancer pool, loadbalancer listener, security group, keypair, image, ...) The api_monitor.sh uses and APIMonitor_TIMESTAMP prefix for all OpenStack resource names. This allows to identify the created resources and clean them up even if things go wrong. TIMESTAMP is an integer number representing the seconds after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (Unix time). This may be the time to check that you have sufficient quota to create the resources. While we only create 6+N VMs (and volumes) with the above call (N being the number of AZs), we would want to increase this number for larger clouds. For single-AZ deployments, we would want to still use 2 networks at least -N 2 to test the ability of the router to route traffic between networks. So expect -n 6 to become -N 2 -n 6 for a very small single-AZ cloud or -n 12 for a large 3 AZ cloud region.

You can change the flavors. If you have to pay for this, also consider that some clouds are not charging by the minute but may count by the started hour. So when you run api_monitor.sh in a loop (which you will) with say 10 VMs (e.g. -N 2 -n 8) in each iteration and run this for an hour with 8 iterations, you will never have more than 10 VMs in parallel and they only are alive a bit more than half of the time, but rather than being charged for ~6 VM hours, you end up being charged for ~80 VM hours. Similar for volumes, routers, floating IPs. This makes a huge difference. Sometimes the cloud under test has issues. That's why we do monitoring ... One thing that might happen is that loadbalancers and volumes (and other resources, but those two are the most prone to this) end up in a broken state that can not be cleaned up by the user any more. Bad providers may charge for these anyhow, although this will never stand a legal dispute. (IANAL, but charging for providing something that is not working is not typically supported by civil law in most jurisdictions and T&Cs that would say so would not normally be legally enforceable.) If this happens, I recommend to keep records of the broken state (store the output of openstack volume list, openstack volume show BROKEN_VOLUME, openstack loadbalancer list, openstack loadbalancer show BROKEN_LB.)

If you want to send mails to more than one recipient, you can do so by passing ALARM_EMAIL_ADDRESSES and NOTE_EMAIL_ADDRESSES environment variables to api_monitor.sh, e.g. by setting it in the run_CLOUDNAME.sh.","s":"eMail","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#email","p":1680},{"i":1710,"t":"api_monitor.sh writes a log file with the name APIMonitor_TIMESTAMP.log. It contains a bit of information to see the progress of the script; more importantly, it logs every single openstack CLI call along with parameters and results. (TIMESTAMP is the Unix time, i.e. seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.) Note that api_monitor.sh does take some care not to expose secrets -- since v1.99, it does also redact issued tokens (which would otherwise give you up to 24hrs of access). But the Log files still may contain moderately sensitive information, so we suggest to not share it with untrusted parties. The log file is written to the file system. After finishing the 200 iterations, the log file is compressed. If the environment variable SWIFTCONTAINER has been set (in run_COULDNAME.sh) when starting api_monitor.sh. the log file will be uploaded to a container with that name if it exists and if the swift object storage service is supported by the cloud. So create the container (a bucket in S3 speak) before if you want to use this: export SWIFTCONTAINER=OSHM_Logs; openstack container create $SWIFTCONTAINER After the 200 iterations, a .psv file (pipe-separated values) is created Stats.STARTTIME-ENDTIME.psv (with times as calendar dates) which contains a bit of statistics on the last 200 iterations.

Set the protocol = https if not enabled by default. You can use a hostname of your liking, but we will need to create TLS certificates for this host. So we should have control over DNS TXT records for this domain if we want to use Let's Encrypt with DNSAUTH. The sovereignit.cloud domain is controlled by the SCS project team and has been used for a number of health mon instances. In this same section, set cert_file = /etc/grafana/health-fullchain.pem and cert_key = /etc/grafana/health-key.pem. Ensure that both files are readable by root:grafana and that the key file is not world-readable. Configure the admin access. In section [security], set the admin_user = admin and admin_password = SOME_SECRET_PASS which you keep private. Allow local data sources (same section): data_source_proxy_whitelist = localhost:8088 localhost:8086 Let's disallow user signup (in section [users]): allow_sign_up = false and allow_org_create = false. We do the OIDC connection with [auth.github] later. We can now restart the service: sudo systemctl restart grafana-server. Being at it, also enable it on system startup: sudo systemctl enable grafana-server. You should now be able to access your dashboard on https://health.YOURCLOUD.sovereignit.de:3000 and log in via the configured username admin and your SOME_SECRET_PASS password. Enable influx database in grafana​ In the dashboard, go to Home, Connections, choose InfluxDB and Add new datasource. The defaults (database name, InfluxQL query language) work. You need to explicitly set the URL to http://localhost:8086 (despite this being the suggestion). Set the database name to telegraf. Save&test should succeed. Importing the dashboard​ Go to Home, Dashboards, New, Import. Upload the dashboard .json file from the repository, user the Grafana-10 variant if you use Grafana 10 or newer. In the dashboard, go to the settings gear wheel, variables, mycloud and add CLOUDNAME to the list of clouds that can be displayed. (There are some existing SCS clouds in that list.) Save. Now choose CLOUDNAME as cloud (top of the dashboard, rightmost dropdown for the mycloud filter variable). No data displayed?​ Sometimes, you may see a panel displaying \"no data\" despite the fact that the first full iteration of data has been sent to influx already. This may be a strange interaction between the browser and Grafana -- we have not analyzed whether that is a bug in Grafana. One way to work around is to go into the setting of the panel (the three dots in the upper right corner), go to edit and start changing one aspect of the query. Apply. Change it back to the original. Apply. The data will appear. Save to be sure it's conserved. Dashboard features​ Look at the top line filters: You can filter to only see certain API calls or certain resources; the graphs are very crowded and filtering to better see what you want to focus on is very well intended. The first row of panels give a health impression; there are absolute numbers as well as percentage numbers and the panels turn amber and red in case you have too many errors. Note that the colors on the panels with absolute numbers can not take into account whether you look at just a few hours or at weeks. Accordingly, consider the colors a reasonable hint if things are green or not when looking at a ~24 hours interval. This limitation does not affect the colors on the percentage graph, obviously. You can change the time interval and zoom in also by marking an interval with the mouse. Zooming out to a few months can be a very useful feature to see trends and watch e.g. your API performance, your resource creation times or the benchmarks change over the long term. github OIDC integration​ The SCS providers do allow all github users that belong to the SovereignCloudStack organization to get Viewer access to the dashboards by adding a client_id and client_secret in the [github.auth] section that you request from the SCS github admins (github's oauth auth). This allows to exchange experience and to get a feeling for the achievable stability. (Hint: A single digit number of API call fails per week and no other failures is achievable on loaded clouds.)","s":"grafana","u":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor","h":"/de/docs/guides/operations-guide/openstack/tools/openstack-health-monitor#grafana","p":1680},{"i":1722,"t":"Install influxdb via apt: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/introduction/install/#installing-influxdb-oss Install telegraf (same apt repo as influxdb): sudo apt update && sudo apt install telegraf Install grafana: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/#install-from-apt-repository Prepare configuration by using the config files from the repository as an alternative to doing the changes manually (as described above): sudo cp dashboard/telegraf.conf /etc/telegraf && sudo chown root:root /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf && sudo chmod 0644 /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf sudo cp dashboard/config.toml /etc/influxdb && sudo chown root:influxdb /etc/influxdb/config.toml && sudo chmod 0640 /etc/influxdb/config.toml sudo cp dashboard/grafana.ini /etc/grafana && sudo chown root:grafana /etc/grafana/grafana.ini && sudo chmod 0640 /etc/grafana/grafana.ini These config files should work as long as the versions of telegraf, influxdb and grafana don't evolve too far from the ones used in the repository.

Without metadata, not ssh key is injected and login will fail. To gather more details, you can look at the console output openstack console log show VM (where VM is the name of the uuid of the affected VM instance). The cloud-init output is often enough to see what has gone wrong. You can log in to the VMs: The jumphosts are directly accessible via ssh -i APIMonitor_XXXXX_JH.pem debian@FIP, whereas the JumpHost does port forwarding to the other VMs that don't have their own floating IP address: ssh -i APIMonitor_XXXXX_VM.pem -p 222 debian@FIP. Replace XXXXX with the number in your current APIMonitor prefix, FIP with the floating IP address of the responsible JumpHost and debian with the user name used by the images you boot. Use 223 to connect to the second VM in the network, 224 the third etc. When logged in, look at /var/log/cloud-init-output.log and /var/log/cloud-init.log. You can find the metadata in /var/lib/cloud/instance/. You will not have much time to look around -- the still running api_monitor.sh script does continue and clean things up again. So you might want to suspend it with ^Z (and continue it later with fg). Another option is to not stop the regular monitoring, but start a second instance manually; see above notes for running multiple instances though. If you start a second instance manually against the same project, do NOT use the run_CLOUDNAME.sh script as it would do cleanup against the running instance, but rather copy the api_monitor.sh command line from the bottom (without the exec), reduce the iterations to a few (unless you need a lot to trigger the issue again) and attach -w -1 to make the script stop its operation (and wait for Enter) once it hits an error. Of course, you still will face cleanup when the continuing main script hits its 200th iteration and you have chosen to run this second instance against the same project in the same cloud.

A volume may not have been named (because of a cinder failure) or all the logic may have gone wrong, e.g. the heuristic to avoid leaking floating IPs. You can try to clean this up using the normal openstack commands (or horizon dashboard). There are a few things that may need support from a cloud admin: Volumes may end up permanently in a deleting or reserved state or may be in-use, attached to a VM that has long gone. The admin needs to set the state to error and then delete them. Loadbalancers may end up in a PENDING_XXX state (XXX being CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE) without ever changing. This also needs the cloud admin to set the status to ERROR, so it can be cleaned up. amphorae are more prone to this than ovn LBs.

In file terraform/clouds.yaml.sample you will find examples of typical setups. Settings that are identical for all users of a cloud can be defined centrally via the profiles of the file terraform/clouds-public.yaml. You can reference these settings by using the profile parameter in cloud-specific definition in terraform/clouds.yaml. The user specific settings of the clouds.yaml file are provided by the cloud provider. Please check the documentation of the cloud provider you are using or their support for details. REGIO.cloud is used as an example here. The cloud name in clouds.yaml and the environment name (value of ENVIRONMENT) are regiocloud in this case. It is important that the name of the cloud in clouds.yaml matches the name of the environment to be used. The names must be identical.

Afterwards no more logs are available in the ARA web interface. To re-enable ARA use /opt/configuration/scripts/enable-ara.sh. There is also the option of pre-population of images with /opt/configuration/scripts/pull-images.sh so that deployments do not have to be lengthy.

The 5: prefix is placed in front of the version. Commit and push the changes to your configuration repository afterwards. The upgrade of Docker is then done with the OSISM CLI. Docker on the manager itself is updated differently. This does not work on the manager itself because the Docker service may be started during the upgrade and individual containers may be started as a result. This would interrupt the run of the role itself. osism apply docker -l 'docker:!manager' By default, serial is set to 1 so that the the hosts are upgrade one after the other. To adjust this, either use the osism_serial dictionary in the environments/configuration.yml file to change the value in docker or append -e serial=10% to upgrade, for example, 10% with each iteration. Please note that it is not a good idea to upgrade more than one Docker service at a time. This can lead to anomalies, especially on storage nodes and control nodes. It is recommended not to change the default of 1. osism_serial: docker: 10% On the manager itself, the run.sh script in the manager environment of the configuration must currently be used to upgrade the Docker service.

As a result, it can come to a restart of the running containers. This can lead to interruptions in individual services. A change in /etc/docker/daemon.json due to a new configuration parameter etc. can also result in a required restart. Whether the containers are restarted when the Docker Service is restarted depends on whether the Live Restore feature is used. This can be configured via the parameter docker_live_restore. Live restore is enabled by default. It is important to set the docker_live_restore parameter explicitly as a string. This means docker_live_restore: \"false\" or docker_live_restore: \"true\". But even if the Live Restore feature is enabled, certain upgrades will cause running containers to be restarted: Live restore allows you to keep containers running across Docker daemon updates, but is only supported when installing patch releases (YY.MM.x), not for major (YY.MM) daemon upgrades. There are two ways to prevent a restart of the Docker service during an upgrade. If the restart behaviour of the Docker service is changed, always make sure to restart the Docker service manually afterwards (e.g. by a system reboot). A host group can be defined via the parameter docker_ignore_restart_groupname. The restart of the Docker service is not triggered for all hosts in this group. By default, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to manager. The parameter is best set in the environments/configuration.yml file when making an adjustment. For example, to prevent the restart on all hosts, docker_ignore_restart_groupname is set to generic. docker_ignore_restart_groupname: generic With the parameter docker_allow_restart, the restart of the Docker service can be prevented. By default, docker_allow_restart is set to true. It is recommended to set this parameter only at runtime.

Usually security groups are assigned to the Port(s) when a virtual machine is created, but assignments can also be changed at runtime later on. Multiple security groups can be assigned to a VM or Port simultaneously and in such case they will be combined as the union of all their rules. caution Security groups are mutable resources. Their rules can be adjusted at any time after creation. Changing the rules of a security group will immediately apply the changes to all Ports or VMs it is assigned to.

Use this information to identify all incoming and outgoing traffic rules that will be needed based on the communication patterns of the services it is meant to deploy. This includes communication protocols, port numbers, communication directions and optionally target/source address ranges. Look through already existing security groups and their rules. If a security group allows more traffic than needed it SHOULD NOT be used. If a security group contains only a subset of the required rules it MAY be used in combination with other security groups that contain rules which fulfill the remaining required traffic rules from point 1. If you were not successful in finding an appropriate combination of existing security groups or you need additional specific rules to cover all requirements, you MAY create one or more new Security Groups in which you can add the required rules.

Notable examples are: SSH SSH is needed on many virtual machines to operate their guest operating system. In a security group the port 22 can be opened for the TCP protocol to allow incoming SSH connections. But that only should be done while also restricting the SSH configuration to public key authentication only (the recommended way) or having a strong username and password policy already applied to the operating system of the virtual machine. Otherwise default usernames and passwords which are often preconfigured in system images may be exploited through the exposed SSH port which enables attackers to compromise the virtual machine. ICMP It might be useful to be able to ping a virtual machine or use other ICMP requests. But for some virtual machine configurations this is either not necessary at all or only temporarily needed. One benefit of security groups among other things is the ability to be easily added to and removed from existing virtual machines.

Overwriting an existing volume with the backup data. note If the volume backup was originally created from a volume that used a non-default encrypted volume type, letting Cinder Backup create a new volume for backup restoration does not work and the volume type must match exactly.

Make sure that no volume with this name already exists. The Cinder Backup service will create the volume with the same size as the backup indicates. Restoring on an existing volume (Cinder Backup)​ As an alternative to creating a new volume as the restore target, the backup can also be restored on an existing volume: openstack volume backup restore --force $BACKUP_NAME_OR_ID $VOLUME_NAME_OR_ID ... which will overwrite the data on the existing volume, regardless of whether it is empty or not! The volume will enter the \"restoring-backup\" state temporarily and will return to the \"available\" state again once the restore process has finished. Restoring an encrypted volume backup (Cinder Backup)​ When restoring a volume backup of a volume that was using a non-default encrypted volume type, a new volume of that type needs to be created first and then the backup restored onto it. Otherwise, the restoration will fail with the target volume ending up in the \"error_restoring\" state. For this procedure to succeed it is necessary to know the exact volume type of the volume the backup was created from. If the source volume of the backup still exists, the original volume type can be determined by inspecting the backup's volume_id attribute and then using it to look up the corresponding volume and its type attribute. The following client command can be used for this (fill in the value for BACKUP_ID): export BACKUP_ID=... SOURCE_VOLUME_ID=\"$(openstack volume backup show $BACKUP_ID -f value -c volume_id)\" openstack volume show -f value -c type \"$SOURCE_VOLUME_ID\" This returns the name of the original volume type.

No upgrades of other OpenStack and associated infrastructure services such as MariaDB or RabbitMQ are required. The Nova images have been rebuilt to add packages to be able to use vTMP (osism/issues#1008) If this is not relevant, the upgrade can be skipped. The octavia images have been rebuilt to resolve an issue when creating a LB + a listener with an allowed_cidr with the fully-populated API (osism/issues#980) When upgrading the Nova and Octavia API services, there is a short downtime of the APIs. This downtime is usually less than 1 minute.","s":"7.0.4 (20240507)","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#704-20240507","p":2079},{"i":2086,"t":"Release date: 3. May 2024 The Ceph service images have not been rebuilt. No upgrade of Ceph is required. The OpenStack service images have not been rebuilt. No upgrade of OpenStack is required. During the preparation of the upgrades of the regions of the PCO a bug (osism/issues#973) has been noticed which leads to a delay of up to 2 minutes between the necessary container stops and starts. This is due to a bug in the service units of all Kolla services. The bug is fixed in the current release. To avoid the delay during an upgrade, a fix must be applied in advance for all service units from Kolla. osism apply fix-gh973 The Kubernetes Cluster API image for the Kubernetes (K8s) 1.30 series is available. The images are now provided directly with osism manage image clusterapi. This means that K8s Cluster API images are now available for K8s series 1.27, 1.28, 1.29 and 1.30. All Ansible collections have been prepared for use with Ubuntu 24.04. It is currently not recommended to upgrade existing clusters to Ubuntu 24.04 or to install new clusters with Ubuntu 24.04. There will be a note in future release notes that announces the full support of Ubuntu 24.04. At the moment everything related to Ubuntu 24.04 is a technical preview. A new role tempest has been added to the Ansible collection osism.validations. This makes it possible to perform significantly more tests than with the previously used osism.validations.refstack role. The new role will be used in the testbed in future to significantly increase the number of tests performed in the CI. New documentation for the project manager and the simple stress. When using the reboot play, it is now possible to wait for the reboot to be completed (osism/issues#758). osism apply reboot \\ -e reboot_wait=yes \\ -e ireallymeanit=yes Monitoring services are now activated by default for the internal Kubernetes cluster. The openstack_cacert parameter used by Kolla is now set to \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\" by default. The previous default was \"\". If this is not wanted, the parameter must be overwritten in environments/kolla/configuration.yml. The ironic_agent_files_directory parameter used by Kolla is now set to /share/ironic by default. The previous default was \"{{ node_custom_config }}\". If this is not wanted, the parameter must be overwritten in environments/kolla/configuration.yml. This is in preparation for the Ironic IPA images no longer being stored in the configuration repository but within the manager service at runtime. The Ironic IPA images are now downloaded from ironic play by default. If this is not wanted, enable_ironic_agent_download_images: false must be set in environments/kolla/configuration.yml. The Ironic IPA images can now also be downloaded independently of the ironic play with osism apply ironic-download-ipa-images. The ceph_cluster_fsid parameter is now generated automatically. It can be removed from environments/configuration.yml. The automatically generated ceph_clusterfs_fsid parameter is set to the value of the fsid parameter from environments/ceph/configuration.yml. You can now use your own hook scripts in osism/cfg-cookiecutter. These are placed in the directory {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/scripts.d/ directory. The scripts are executed in alphabetical order. The scripts must be executable. Versions not yet pinned in the manager environment of the configuration repository (Ansible collections, osism/cfg-generics, ..) are now automatically pinned during synchronisation with gilt overlay. This also applies to the osism update manager script. The Docker version and the Docker CLI version can now also be managed via osism/cfg-generics. It is recommended to pin the Docker version in environments/configuration.yml. docker_version: '5:24.0.9' When using the single service plays for Ceph (ceph-osds, ceph-mons, ..), no service restarts are executed for other services. This can be adjusted with the ceph_handler_*_restart parameters. The default value is false. ceph_handler_crash_restart ceph_handler_mdss_restart ceph_handler_mgrs_restart ceph_handler_mons_restart ceph_handler_osds_restart ceph_handler_rbdmirrors_restart ceph_handler_rgws_restart The following example now makes it possible when adding new OSDs to really only start the OSDs that have been newly added and to avoid a restart of all OSDs in the cluster or on a node. osism apply ceph-osds -e ceph_handler_osds_restart=False The restart of Ceph Services is now throttled. By default, only one Ceph service is restarted at a time. This can be adjusted with the ceph_handler_*_restart_throttle parameters. The default value is 1. ceph_handler_crash_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mdss_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mgrs_restart_throttle ceph_handler_mons_restart_throttle ceph_handler_osds_restart_throttle ceph_handler_rbdmirrors_restart_throttle ceph_handler_rgws_restart_throttle OVN container images will be built without the -march=broadwell parameter in the future. The OVN images have not been updated with this release, this only serves as an announcement for the future. By removing the parameter, it is possible to use the OVN container images on older CPUs. It is planned to provide different variants of the OVN and OVS container images in the future to enable parameters for modern CPUs in order to improve performance in particular. This has nothing to do with the release itself and is just a notice. The build of the OpenStack Zed images has been disabled.","s":"7.0.3 (20240503)","u":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7","h":"/de/docs/release-notes/osism-7#703-20240503","p":2079},{"i":2088,"t":"Release date: 17.

No migration from the old deployment via Docker Compose to the new deployment via Kubernetes has been prepared. If you are currently using the Keycloak service, do not upgrade the Keycloak service and contact us in advance. The Keystone role service is required by a number of OpenStack services.

When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to upgrade MariaDB first. When migrating to ProxySQL, it is important to perform the loadbalancer upgrade before all OpenStack service upgrades. To make sure that the OpenStack services continue to work after the upgrade when ProxySQL is enabled as part of the upgrade, the ProxySQL service must have been deployed first. The ProxySQL service is deployed with the loadbalancer play. It is possible that connectivity with the database may be interrupted for a short time during the migration.

The Ansible callback plugin osism.commons.still_alive is now available to avoid timeouts for long-running tasks. This currently has to be explicitly enabled in the Ansible configuration. This is done in the environments/ansible.cfg file in the configuration repository. The callback plugin is enabled by default in the future. After this change has been made, the update of the manager must be performed. A manager with a version before OSISM 7.0.0 cannot be longer used if this plugin is set in environments/ansible.cfg. environments/ansible.cfg [defaults] ... stdout_callback = osism.commons.still_alive In the inventory, the nova_backend parameter must be added to the host vars of compute nodes where local storage is used. nova_backend: default The SSL certificate file haproxy.pem is now available in a different location in the haproxy container. Previously it was stored under /etc/haproxy/haproxy.pem. From now on it is stored under /etc/haproxy/certificates/haproxy.pem. If you have customised the configuration for the haproxy service or use overlays for this, adjust the locations of the SSL certificate as required. Due to the upgrade from Fluentd to version 5, some directory names within the container image for Fluentd have changed. If you have worked with overlay files in the Fluentd service, check these in advance. Currently we know that /var/run/td-agent is now available as /var/run/fluentd (check osism/issues#864 for details). We assume that other directory names have changed similarly.
